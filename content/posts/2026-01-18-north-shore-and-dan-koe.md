The story of the day was going to the North Shore with Abby. Watching the Da Hui Backdoor Shootout, getting Ted's ($25 for a Mahi Mahi plate!) and snorkeling in Sharks Cove. Dinner at a really good skewer house called Khan Skewer House near UH.

My mind keeps taking me back to the Dan Koe article or essay that he wrote about changing your life in one day. I still haven't read the full thing and I need to—should be on my to-do list for this week. It's a good reminder, but the first few paragraphs already had an impact on me. It's just a reminder that you can set all the goals that you want, make as many New Year's resolutions as you want—90% of them you're not going to ever accomplish. Doesn't mean you don't try, but...

Here is the quote:

> **"You aren't where you want to be because you aren't the person who would be there."**

The truth of the matter is if you want to accomplish something grand—say you want to be an entrepreneur or you want to be a good parent—you need to start doing the things that an entrepreneur would do. You need to start embodying what a good parent is.

It might sound obvious, but the more you think about it, there's a deeper level of nuance to that.

Let's go with the good parent example. Let's say you like to indulge in some bad habits. Say you like to eat cake after every single meal. Now when you become a parent, you know that as a good parent, you're not supposed to tell your kid, "Hey, you can eat dessert after every meal." But if you're eating dessert after every single meal yourself, you're not embodying what a good parent is. When you start to realize this and you are able to stop eating cake after every meal—in fact, you only have dessert once a month now—you start to believe in yourself. You start to understand and you start to convince yourself that you are the type of person who will be a good parent because you are a good role model, and good role models will be good parents.

---

My takeaway from this reading is that you first need to convince yourself that you are the type of person who will accomplish your goals. Because if you aren't convinced, you're not going to have confidence and conviction in your goals that you're going to be able to accomplish, and you probably won't accomplish what you set out to do. That is the first step to becoming who you want to be.

An entrepreneur doesn't waste time watching 3 hours of TV a night.

Ultimately what it comes down to is lifestyle.

> **"If you want a specific outcome in life, you have to have a lifestyle that creates that outcome."**

You want to be a good parent? You're probably not going out drinking with your friends every Friday and Saturday night till 2:30 a.m. You're getting your exercise in before the kids wake up, so that you can make them breakfast.

I think I have internalized this part of the essay and look forward to reading the other parts:

- II – You aren't where you want to be because you don't want to be there
- III – You aren't where you want to be because you're afraid to be there
- IV – The life you want lies within a specific level of mind
- V – Intelligence is the ability to get what you want out of life
- VI – How to launch into a completely new life (in 1 day)
- VII – Turn Your Life Into A Video Game

Alpha published the premium version of the practice planner two days ago. Let's see how it goes. I think this month will give me a chance to reset, refactor, clean up things, and then reassess if it's what I want to be doing.
