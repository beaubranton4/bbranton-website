Today I finally published the public version of the practice planner along with a ton of other changes added analytics for tracking tool usage in my website. improved SEO of a ton of different pages, reorganized the homepage, cleaned up the navigation menu, and updated a lot of different text, and cleaned up a ton of my project. So, made a ton of progress, but also starting to feel like, "Man, what comes next if I build out this practice planner?" And, you know, maybe it gets a few more sign-ups than what's going to be next for me. I'm really hoping that the spring season, the baseball season, gets me at least over 100 sign-ups. That's kind of my goal, I think. But I don't really know what else to do from there. I think after this is social media, building a brand, building a social media channel. There's small stuff, but I'm wondering if it'll scale, or if I should start working on some other projects. It's the same question I've asked myself again and again over the last couple of months. I've continued down the path of dugout edge, but how far can it take me?

I really had a productive day today signed up for Planet Fitness $15 a month which is absolutely crazy. Got a good workout in, also spent a nice day outside in Waikiki walking all the way down the beach and posting up in at Kapiolani Park reading my book Storyworthy, listening to some of the author of Storyworthy's speeches and realizing that, hey, you know what, I could be a good storyteller too. So I'm going to commit to telling a story this week, writing a story and posting it on this website and I look forward to doing that. Now the question is what story? The key points that I've learned is that all stories are about a five second snippet in time where a single character experiences change. That's what it boils down to.

The author, I can't remember all I know is his last name is Dick, has given a couple of exercises. One is to just write down that one story a day. It's your daily homework is to write down the biggest story or the most important story from your day. So I'm going to do that. I've written down a few because I like to remember all these things. Then there's also crash and burn, which is just write continuously, which is another exercise I can probably benefit from. And then there's, I think there's one more, but I'm blanking right now. In either case, I think that I'm doing this right. I'm learning how to speak through talking to you, right, transcribing all of my thoughts and my daily journals. Yes, super whisper. And I hope to continue doing that.
