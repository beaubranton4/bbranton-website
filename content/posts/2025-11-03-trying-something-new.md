Today I'm trying something new. I'm going to do my daily journal in the form of a voice recording instead of doing it through ChatGPT.

Just for some context, over the last 60 days, I've attempted to write a journal entry on a daily basis, which I then save and post to my personal website, which I started about a week before my 30th birthday. The goal with these daily journals was to, one, just have a place to share my thoughts, to start writing more essentially. Because the better writer you are, the better speaker you are, the better thinker you are. And I know that if you don't use it, you lose it. So that's one reason.

The second reason is that I want to begin just kind of documenting my thoughts on a daily basis because I think, you know, in 10, 15 years, it will be really cool if I'm able to keep up with this habit on a daily basis. It could really be a cool thing to look at. Especially if I accomplish anything or I want to share it with my kids. Or just for my own self, just looking back and seeing what I was thinking about at the time.

With the rise of AI and ChatGPT, it's been really helpful to record all of my daily journals as voice recordings, which then I hit submit, I tell that, hey, this is my daily journal. Just clean it up a little bit. I'd like to make a blog post and basically just reformats everything and then creates a text entry.

But I'm starting to realize, like, hey, if I'm gonna do that in ChatGPT and speak everything, I might as well record my voice. In fact, now I'm thinking I might as well just record myself doing this on video on a daily basis. I can still get the same output. I can still get a voice recording. I'll get a video, and then I'll also get written text. I can transcribe the video. So maybe I'll start doing that. I'd have to build a system for me to start doing that. But I'm sure it's not too difficult. I'm pretty sure I can just upload a video. I can automate the process of transcribing it. I can turn it into a voice recording. There may be some sort of cost, I think, through maybe OpenAI tokens or something, but it's going to be minimal. So maybe it's worth doing that. Maybe I'll do that on my website, and then, you know, if I'm feeling brave, I could even just start posting this onto a social media channel. So yeah, that's something that I've been thinking about.

What else? I think I had some other things to think about, but, you know, honestly, I'm just so busy. Five minutes out of the day is like, all I can afford, because I really need to lock in and focus on some other things.

Oh, I remember the thought that I had. It's the exact same thought as that, like, I overcommit to things. I feel like you think you have so much time when I'm writing in my journal about what I need to get done. I write down so many things and I accomplish about like 10% of them, right? You overestimate what you can do in a day, but you underestimate what you can do in 10 years. I think that's 100% true.

And I think that one of the biggest things I'm starting to internalize right now is that focus is essential. You can't work on too many things at once. This is actually something that Tommy told me that stuck with me in college is that you can have. There are three kind of big things as a baseball player that you focus on. It's one's academics. Second is social life. Third is baseball. And you can't have all three. You have to sacrifice one for the other. And you think of it as a Venn diagram, you can pick two and it's really hard to pick three. You know, somehow that dude did three. But he was special.

So yeah. Intense focus on what you need to get done is like, solve so many of the issues that I think people think that they have when it comes to life, I guess. So for me, I think it's. If I had to pick two, it's becoming an entrepreneur, and it's my personal fitness. Right? That's all I need to focus on right now.
