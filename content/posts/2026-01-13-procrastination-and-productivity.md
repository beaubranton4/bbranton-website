January 13th, 2026. I spent a lot of time procrastinating today. Funny enough, I procrastinated with good things. I spent two hours revamping my personal website, and I worked out twice. I went on a five mile run and got a good lift in Epikim. I got even the third one in if you consider going to the range of work out. I spent a lot of time with my family, a dinner, a lunch with them. It's not a bad day at all by any means. Just kind of neglected what I believe is my number one priority being Dugout Edge. But all in all, great day. Also got a lot of work done on the wedding list to finalize that. Story of the day would be never being able to drive the ball when playing on a golf course, but when at the range, I'm piping it down the middle, dead straight and long like a young Tiger Woods.

Discovering it's all in the grip. The pre-setup thought for me is getting a wiggle in just by purely kind of toggling my wrists, getting the feel that I'm on plane to strike the ball just with the little movements of my wrist which will eventually translate to the fuller swing. Hard to explain, but I should know what I'm talking about.

Today at work I spent maybe 30 minutes working on something that probably would have taken me a good three four hours. I wrote an entire data model to calculate turnaround times from basically a change log history table, which, you know, I wouldn't say it's the hardest thing in the world, but definitely more of an intermediate level task that really will take a lot of time and effort, especially given that you have to write a lot of window functions, but was able to do so in about 30 minutes. Definitely, it's my experience plus my ability to prompt, that allowed me to do this so quickly. I don't think that any Jo Schmo off the street given this problem would have just been able to know immediately how to solve this or what to do, but it's still just so crazy how powerful these tools are when given the proper guidance. I feel sort of stuck in this limbo on what to do about my future. Do I learn a new skill that I know will play in this new world? Real content creation, building a following, creating an in-person product, building an in-person business, learning a trade. Do I learn how to leverage these tools like I'm trying to do now and I think that's kind of the path that I'm taking? Do I just continue down the path of a career person, a data analyst, knowing that or assuming that AI will never be good enough to completely replace me? It's a hard question to noodle on.
