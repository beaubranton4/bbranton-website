excerpt: "Bedroom, office, JCC. Strong workout, nearly passed out—second time in over a year, something to watch. Finished Pulp Fiction (entertaining, not historic). Stop using Opus 4.6. Looking for real-world reasons: wiffle ball, baseball, choir? Zooming out: do I want to say I spent these years on a computer for freedom later—trading freedom now? Should I track decisions and conversations to build AI agents that replicate my thinking?"

Another day, moving between the bedroom, my office, and JCC. Had a strong workout today and nearly passed out. Just pushing a little bit too hard I think. But I had breakfast and everything. Just something to keep an eye on—it's the second time it's happened to me after a workout. Last time was maybe over a year ago.

Finished watching Pulp Fiction. Entertaining, but didn't think it was historic by any means.

Have to remember to stop using Opus 4.6. That shit is a waste of money!

Looking for reasons to live in the real world and have real experiences. Wiffle ball? Baseball? Choir?

I'm not necessarily unhappy spending my days working and building Dugout Edge. But it's the introspective bird's-eye view. When I zoom out—do I really want to say I spent all these years of my life sitting on the couch or in the office working on a computer? I'm telling myself that it's for freedom down the road, but am I trading my freedom now? The best years of my life.

Another thing I keep thinking: should I be smarter about how I build? Should I be tracking my decisions and my conversations so I can build AI agents and replicate my decision-making and prompting?
