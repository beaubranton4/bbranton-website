excerpt: "The holiday season is over and it's back to the routine. Reflecting on being a doer vs. a planner, and the trap of spending too much time planning and collecting data points instead of taking action. The reminder: do more right now and keep doing until you can look back and say 'wow look how far I've come'."

With the blink of an eye, the holiday season is over. It's a new year and continue on the treadmill of life. Treadmill makes it sound monotonous and boring, but I envisioned the globe spinning round and round the sun, and while that remains consistent, so much happens on this globe.

A few thoughts for the day. I've always been a doer. I hate reading instructions and planning. I learn by doing and always have. In the past few years, I've gotten really good at planning. On one hand, it's great because paired with my bias for action now I'm running, and more often than not, running in the right direction.

the trap i need to avoid is spending too much time planning, and learning and collecting data points. Because although that may get me pointed in the right direction, if the 3rd component of time is being factored in then i may end up losing the race. Self improvement, scrolling twitter, even planning my days and creating this elaborate system for documenting my life may be overkill. We'll see.

do more right now and keep doing until you can look back and say, "wow look how far I've come"
