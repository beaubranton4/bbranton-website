excerpt: "Thinking about Buddhism and its practices. Fixing posture, upper neck/track tightness, chest/shoulder tightness affecting breathing and inducing anxiety—root cause is sitting hunched over screens all day, then tensed workouts. Five years of mental space taken up by this. Third theme: what business to build—Dugout Edge doing well, ~2-3 signups/day, nearly 50 customers if everyone converts. Taking on GameChanger? So many ideas: scouting platform, chalkboard for situations, scheduling tools, brackets. Buddhism resonates—don't do what causes suffering, don't harm, meditation and breathing."

I've been thinking a lot about a couple of different things. One is Buddhism and the practice of Buddhism. The second is how I can fix my posture and my upper neck and track tightness and chest and shoulder tightness that seems to be impacting my breathing and inducing anxiety—and how I'll greatly improve my life if I could develop routines and practices to help negate this. I think the root cause is sitting all day, hunched over a screen in front of a computer, tensed up, working out hard at the gym where I'm tensed up again in my upper body, doing a lot of chest and shoulders. It's just overall impacting my well-being because it's taken a significant amount of mental space in my brain for the last five years. I really think it all has to do with this tightness and this posture that can be negated through stretching, exercises, and movement. And of course, doing less sitting, doing less being hunched over at a computer, stiff, not moving.

The third thing is the common theme of how I can spend my time, what I should build, what sorts of business I want to spend my life building. And right now that seems to be Dugout Edge. How can I help baseball players, youth baseball players and coaches and parents, and grow the game that way? How can I give back in that sense? And I think I'm well on my way. I think I need to dream bigger, think bigger.

Obviously Dugout Edge has been doing really well. It's baseball season. I'm still averaging maybe two or three signups a day over the last two weeks. If everybody converts from a free trial, I'm probably going to be at nearly 50 customers, which is awesome. Halfway to my goal of 100 customers for this year.

I keep hoping to myself that I should take on GameChanger. There's been so much back and forth on Reddit about how GameChanger sucks and how people want this feature improved and how they don't deliver this and how they're making every single parent and fan pay for a subscription. It's $240 for our entire team. I think I'm significantly under that—I just charge $60 per month for Dugout Edge for the coach and he gets unlimited teams for years. Maybe I just make the games open. I'm not sure yet what it can become—some sort of scouting platform. There are just so many ideas. I also want to build a chalkboard that I can help them with play situations and teach exactly. I also think that there's a big opportunity to get into tools for leads and lead coordinators, such as a scheduling tool for the season, a tournament scheduling tool, like a bracket creator. Just so many ideas I have. So little time.

And going back to Buddha, I'm finding that I really resonate with the teachings. I don't even know the specifics and I'm not getting too academic about it. But what I'm taking away are the values, the beliefs, and the practices of Buddha. I'm following up and talking about this a little bit more, but it's basically just re-emphasizing everything that I know deep down and what at the end of the day is really common sense. I think it's common sense because my parents taught it to me or I learned it through life experience, and it's really simple. Don't do what causes you suffering, and we ultimately know what causes suffering—it's indulgence. Don't think about harming or killing. Find peace through meditation and breathing.
