This weekend was one of the best of my life. Don't have the energy to go over in detail but will take 30 minutes and write it all down tomorrow. Epic trip to the Big Island with Abby and my parents.

Lessons about reacting to things out of your control and things that can't be changed. Treating people you love the right way. The power of acting and doing now.
