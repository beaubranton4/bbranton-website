It's Thanksgiving here in America. I don't know why I'm saying in America. I've always lived in America. Also not true. I'm just lying through my teeth right now - hot start to a day of feeling thankful grounded in humble pie.

I'm on vacation. Feels good. It's been a long time since I've taken PTO and layer that in with Thanksgiving and day off Friday. It's going to be a nice long vacation for me. About 12 days. And I'm really excited to just decompress. Explore a new country. Going to Switzerland tomorrow, and then we'll be there for 10 days with Abby, Kenji, Tiana, and mom and dad.

I'll probably take a break from building out all this stuff. I'll bring my laptop, just probably won't have as much time or desire to be working on a lot of my projects on my computer, but will try my best to continue journaling, sharing my thoughts on maybe a new country, my perspective on a new country, and kind of what I've observed.

We'll keep this one brief. Happy Thanksgiving to all. And hope you eat lots.
