Problems I Came Across Today:

1) Elderly folks who are in care facilities have to take care of bills. Sometimes bills are still being sent to their original home. Who is helping them?

2) Lost all my work because I accidentally deleted the src folder and hadn't committed my changes.

3) Mosquitoes biting me all over the place when I'm home!

4) Trip planning is a pain. But it's all to do with preferences.

5) Wedding Planning

Another day of grinding on Dugout Edge, working through the premium version of the practice planner. I made a big mistake today. I accidentally deleted my entire source folder after making probably three hours worth of edits without committing. Was able to salvage maybe 80% of the code by going into all of the cloud agent conversations and then reverting history and then telling it to basically that, hey, accidentally deleted stuff. Please fix the code so that it's at the, um, so that we can, you know, bring back the code to the latest point and it sort of worked. I ended up missing a couple of things, um, but serves me right. I should know to commit my work, um, just pretty much on every change if possible.

I added it to the cloud.md file, really happy with the enhancements that I made yesterday, system notifications, updating the cloud.md file. Those have been two, you know, big, big changes for me and increase my efficiency gains.

Visited Antimerna today too, went to Haleho Aloha, which is the nursing home that she's at. Um, I'd really like to write a story about her. She for the biggest time was my biggest cheerleader growing up, um, throughout my baseball career. She was at all my games. She cheered, she watched, she sent videos. Um, and she doesn't know it, but I'm secretly her biggest cheerleader right now. I think as I get older, I realized how much pain and struggle she must have gone through in her life just to get where she, she is today being a midget. And I think for the longest time I was embarrassed by that, especially when I was at Stanford and I hated the fact that I was the shortest player on the team. And when people would see her and me together say, "Oh, Bo is a midget." You know, I, that thought always crossed my mind. No one ever said it. And I'm embarrassed that I thought that way. So, um, a lot of respect for her and what she does and what she's been through and how impactful she is and, you know, how successful she is in her own way. You know, she didn't have the easiest life, never got married, but she was a very successful accountant in her own regard and an accountant to Israel Kamakavi Valole, somewhere over the rainbow guy, which blows my mind.

Anyways, um, that was my big story for today and I think on Sunday maybe I should just kind of sit down and try and write out that story. Maybe just like a first draft. I'm not sure what the story will be. Maybe I need to figure out a different story, but there's a story to be told with her for sure. Um.
