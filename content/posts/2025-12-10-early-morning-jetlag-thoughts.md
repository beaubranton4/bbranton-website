I'm up at 5am this morning at the mercy of jetlag. I went to bed around 10 so it wasn't a horrible nights sleep (despite what my Garmin said).

As soon as I woke up, I was thinking about business ideas. I'm not sure why my mind is so drawn to thinking about these sorts of thinks. Is it just second-nature? Is it my brain giving me a sign? Or maybe is it just an addiction? 

For whatever reason, thinking about business and ideas and projects has consumed me for the last 7 or so years, so I don't think I can fight it at this point. Obviously I need to listen, but i'm struggling because i'm always thinking of new ideas and new projects. Shiny object syndrome. The logical part of my brain says i need to focus on one. 

My Business Checklist:

I need to focus on a problem i am deeply and intimately familiar with
I enjoy doing the work required to make this business succeed (or can hire someone to do the parts I don't)


My Business Shortlist:

- Hat company
- A tool to help me stay organized in my life (to-do's, journals, reminders, notes, screenshots, etc.)


IDEA/CONCEPT 1 (ANALYTICS):

I was thinking about an AI powered analytics tool (novel i know lol) for indie hackers. Similar to how supabase is a super user friendly plug and play back end and database, i want to build something that makes it super simple to setup and start tracking whatever you want.

Track what matters. Analyze what matters. Do what matters.

Imagine a tool that is connected via MCP server to Stripe, Google Analytics and is integrated with your github. Through natural language, you tell it what it wants, it would embed the analytics within your project, and the result is analytics on-demand.

How many users viewed this page? then clicked this button? then signed up? 

Very simple, but that data lives in 3 seperate systems of record. Page views (GA4), button click (posthog), sign up (backend/stripe)

I wish i had a DB that contained all of these without having to sync via an expensive tool like fivetran and where i could type natural language queries and it would all be there in one place for me.

IDEA/CONCEPT 2 (REFERENCE FOR UI/DESIGN AND VIBE CODERS)

Vibe coders will tell you that LLM's and coding agents love examples. Say you want to build out a landing page and have a certain design in mind - a concept. If you're giving it a screenshot of a UI, that's better than describing it. If you can give it a screenshot with the underlying html/tailwind css even better.

Copying is inevitable in this new world, so why not give people a place to find design and UI inspiration/ the code/ and the prompt to one shot build these things.

Like a pinterest board for vibe coders.

Another reason I'm writing these journals is because I want my voice and thoughts documented somewhere for AI to reference. I'm still trying to wrap my head around why, but i just feel like it will be helpful.
