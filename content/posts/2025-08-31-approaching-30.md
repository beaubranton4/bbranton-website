I can't believe it's already the end of August—almost September. In just four days I turn 30. It's incredible to reflect on the past 30 years and realize that I might already be halfway through this short but incredible journey of life.

As I think about the next 30 years, a few things stand out that I really want to prioritize: embracing adventure, embracing fun, and rooting myself back in who I am—or maybe more importantly, who I was as a kid. Over the last five to seven years—what I'd call true adulthood—my focus has been on finding a job, learning how to make it on my own, and figuring out how to navigate the responsibilities of life. It's been good, honestly. I've learned so much, and I've had plenty of fun. But I can't shake the sense that my direction and goals weren't fully aligned with how I really want to be living.

I've spent a lot of my time working for others, and what I keep coming back to is the desire to invest that same effort into my own mission—something I truly value. More than anything, I think starting my own business and working for myself is the shift I need to make. I don't know if it will actually bring me happiness, but at the very least it will make for a good story. And I want to do more things that make for good stories.

I also want to lean into curiosity—doing things simply because I enjoy them, not because I think they're the "right" thing to do. That's something I've lost track of along the way. I need to structure my days more deliberately, thinking through how I want to spend my time, not just letting life pull me along. A daily to-do list could help me build that structure.

Last night, for example, I went down a rabbit hole on online shopping. I was thinking about building an online store using stock images—just testing if people will actually buy before I even have the product. I think that's a crucial principle: sell before I build. Sell before I have the product. That should be the rule.

Because the truth is, I just spent five months—not grinding nonstop, but still spending maybe 20 solid nights—working on Dugout Edge. And now, three days after launching premium, not a single person has signed up or even hit the paywall page. That tells me something. People don't really want what I'm offering them, at least not in its current form. That's hard to admit, but it's important.

So instead of sinking more time into building things I think people will want, maybe I need to reverse it: gauge interest first, make sure people are willing to pay, and then build the product. That feels like the smarter way forward.

Another big realization I've been having is around how to test demand before I actually build. There are a handful of ways I can see myself doing this, especially by leveraging AI.

One approach is to build a social media account, grow a community, and actually talk with them. Just ask directly: What do you want? What problems do you need solved? If I can build trust and gather those insights early, I won't waste time creating something nobody cares about.

Another approach is to use AI-generated images to create mock products. I can run ads against those, create simple landing pages or fake websites, and see how many people click or even try to buy. That gives me instant feedback on whether there's demand.

There's also the strategy of simply marketing different ideas on social media—posting content, testing different angles—and seeing which ones gain traction and go viral. The ones that resonate organically are signals worth chasing.

All of these methods boil down to the same core principle: test first, sell first, build later. I've known this lesson for a while, but now I think I've truly internalized it. Dugout Edge showed me how much time and energy I can pour into something before realizing people don't really want it. The upside is that now I'm armed with a sharper mindset. I don't see it as wasted effort—it's more like a paid lesson.

And so, the overall takeaway is a positive one: I've clarified that I need to validate ideas quickly and cheaply, and only invest in building once I know there's real demand.
