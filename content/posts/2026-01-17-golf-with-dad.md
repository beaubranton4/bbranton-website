Nice early morning Saturday. Story of the day was playing golf with dad. Played like shit. But... it was fun nonetheless.

Thinking about the braddahs from Maui. One of them definitely owned their own electrical/construction company. I need to remind myself that owning a business is the way to go.

Maybe I don't need to be reminded, but the reminder is that providing things that people need—like really need—is a sure fire way to provide value and have financial success.

Spent the last 4 hours polishing Dugout Edge. About to publish the premium version of the practice planner then pickup Abby from the airport. Time to relax :)
