title: Build for My World

I really need to start automating these daily journals—record them, summarize them, post them into GetSaved as Markdown, upload to GitHub, and have them auto-deploy to Vercel. That would be incredible.

A few things have been on my mind. First: I'm sick of this tech bubble. Second: I need to start solving problems that are directly connected to my own life—the things I see, the people around me, the world I actually live in. I need to stop consuming other people's perspectives—social media, the news, random online "thoughts." I need to trust my own.

My focus should be on helping the people closest to me—my real-world community. The thirty people I'd invite to Liverpool. The thirty I'd invite to a Halloween party. The people I go to the gym with. The people who live around me in Pac Heights. That's my network. That's my community. Those are the people I actually care about.

I've never felt deeply connected to any online community, so why am I building for them? I'm not someone who naturally participates in online forums or groups. I like real people, real settings, face-to-face connection. I need to build for my world, not the internet's version of it.

As for this whole tech bubble—I'm just over it. It's all ARR, startups, AI—everyone chasing faster growth, bigger valuations, more money. Nobody's really doing anything meaningful. I love technology. I love its potential—the things it can enable, the creative ways we can use it. But I hate the culture around it right now. It's all "scale," "move fast," "grind harder," "optimize," "blitzscale."

I don't want to live like that. I want to live well. I want to enjoy life—spend time with people I love, go to trivia nights, play wiffle ball, work out, go camping. I want my life to feel efficient not because I'm hustling, but because I've built systems that let me focus on the things that matter.

The challenge is that those things don't always make money. The stuff that lights me up—connection, laughter, shared experiences—isn't the stuff that scales. But if I truly want to be an entrepreneur or solopreneur, if I want to make money doing something I love while being my own boss, then I need to stop looking so far away from home.

The people around me have real problems. I have real problems. They may not be world-ending, but they're real—and solvable. That's where I should start. Build for myself. Build for my circle. Solve the problems I can actually see and feel.

That's how I'll build something real.
