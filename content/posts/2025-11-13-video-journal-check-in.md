Tried a video journal again today, but I probably won’t keep doing these because of the storage hit. I also don’t speak my best when I’m distracted by how I look on camera. 

Update: too long to upload

recap:

rainy day in SF

I need to work on things in series as opposed to as in parallel. You lose some output context switching so often.

Figure out sole purpose. Nothing wrong with quitting, but quit spreading myself so thin.

I literally bought 4 domains yesterday. Does it even make sense to try something with them?

May be at a good stopping point with Dugout Edge. It will make money while I sleep.

Time to move on? Or time to double down?
