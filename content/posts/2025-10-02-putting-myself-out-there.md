excerpt: "Reflections on sharing Dugout Edge online, the value of building in public, and trying Australian football for the first time."

Last night I stayed up for about an hour and a half crafting a LinkedIn post. It was an update about Dugout Edge, the website I launched, and how I built nearly all of it using AI. The point I wanted to make was that AI isn't just a tool—it's leverage. It's allowing people to do things they never could before, not just work smarter or faster, but accomplish things entirely outside of their previous skill sets.

I stressed over the post way more than I probably should have. When I think about it from the outside, to other people it's just another thing on their feed. They see it, maybe think about it for half a second, and then it's gone. Still, I woke up at 8:30 this morning and found myself editing it again, tweaking it three or four times, worrying it wasn't landing right. But looking back now, it's doing fine. Twenty-something likes, a couple of comments, even a few texts from friends. More importantly, it's brought me new followers, random people interested in what I'm building, and traffic to the site. That's a win.

I think one of my goals needs to be getting more comfortable with this process—putting myself out there online. In reality, it's not a big deal. Starting a batting cage business, now that would be a risk. Posting online? That's easy. Everyone can post, and posts are a dime a dozen. But I also think it's today's lottery ticket. If I can learn how to craft hooks, grab attention, and grow across different platforms, that's a skill that will serve me long-term.

Dugout Edge is the perfect vehicle for this. One, it gives me cover—if I don't want my name or face out front, the brand can stand on its own. Two, it gives me focus. I don't have to stress about what to talk about; I can stay rooted in baseball. Coaches, players, training, even tangential baseball content—it all works. It markets my tool while also teaching me the skill of building an audience online.

I keep coming back to the thought that this project could be my ticket to freedom. Right now, revenue is small—$120 MRR—but it's real. I know it will fluctuate. With fall ball wrapping up and winter coming, churn is inevitable. The yearly subscribers won't pay out again until next year. But I'm not worried. There are so many revenue streams in baseball I haven't tapped yet.

I could push affiliate revenue, Mediavine ads, or premium coaching packages. I could sell practice plans, training modules, even a batting cage directory. I could create and sell physical lineup cards. Baseball is a massive ecosystem, and Dugout Edge gives me a way into all of it. It would be foolish to walk away now.

The answer is simple: keep going. Put my foot on the gas, keep creating, keep posting, and see where this momentum takes me.

Yesterday I also went to my first Australian football practice, invited by Gareth and Chris. It was actually a really fun time. I loved being out there, moving around, pushing myself physically, and following instructions. It challenged me both physically and mentally, and I found myself really enjoying the process of learning a new sport. Honestly, I kind of wish "practice" was its own thing—like there was a business where people could just show up and practice. Organized practice. Maybe there's a designated coach for each session, and a simple piece of software to track who's attending. The coach for that day runs the drills, assigns positions, and sets the focus. That idea excites me, because practice feels so valuable on its own, even without the games.

I met some cool people there, and I'd like to go back. I don't know if I'll ever actually play in a match, but I'd love to keep practicing—working on my kicks, refining my punches, learning how to tackle, and figuring out how to avoid tackles myself. It was a good time, the kind of experience that reminds me how much I enjoy being active, learning, and just showing up to try something new.
