excerpt: "The atmospheric river storm has started in SF with rain forecasted for the next week. Went to Family Billiards with a friend, had inspiring conversations about AI and careers. Realized I'm ahead of the curve on AI technology even though it doesn't feel like it - we all live in different worlds with different algorithms."

I now remember why I spend every December in Hawaii with my parents. The atmospheric river storm has started in SF and it doesn't seem like it's going to be stopping anytime soon. There's rain on the forecast for the next week or so and so it's looking like a rainy Christmas.

I went to Family Billiards last night with my buddy. It's great to see that place is still in business. We both weren't all that focused on the pool but had some really good and inspiring conversations about what we've been working, and how we think AI will impact the world and our careers. Later on, I even got to show him the inner plumbing of Dugout Edge and he shared some tips about how to use AI for testing front end features.

My buddy is a front-end engineer by profession who works at a successful startup. Yet, it's mind blowing that I was able to teach him stuff about his own craft. He didn't know what MCP servers were!

It just goes to show that the world's we all live in are so different. Just because my world is filled with certain facts and data points that i consume on my phone, it doesn't mean that the whole world knows about it. We've all got different algorithms. I'm ahead of the curve when it comes to AI and technology, even though it feels like I'm not. It's all about perspective.

I'm going to Archimedes Banya today with some of the guys. It's basically what I was thinking should exist like the spa I went to on Mt. Rigi in Switzerland. It's barely in SF though but excited to check it out.
