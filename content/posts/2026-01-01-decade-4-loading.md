Decade 4 loading...

Had the best new year's dinner with friends last night. Started off the year with a bang in the best way possible. Feeling it this morning...

I'm committed to drinking less and taking care of my health and hoping to drink less than 3 times a month (36 times all of 2026). I think this will be the hardest goal to accomplish so let's see how we do. Hoping you all will hold me accountable.

Not off to a good start and today was a bit of a slog. Just woke up and ate and then slept again. it's 5pm again lol.

My brain just can't stop thinking of new ideas and what I need to get done.

I'd like to revamp this website and make it look like a claude code terminal with and IDE. Almost like a chat box type interface, but you could still navigate the site if you want to. 

Need to stay away from this building software for software people game. I don't think i can win here. I can build software for non-software people though and should double down there.

Read an essay on twitter about how the UI is dead. In an AI native world, there doesn't really need to be buttons to click, or things to filter. I should just be able to tell it. Surely there are still things where a UI is helpful, especially when it comes to the output being consumed by a human. Until neuralink that is...

I can't stop thinking that we need a second brain. I know others online are thinking it too. Some are building it i can only assume. I'd like to build one specifically for myself. In many ways this website is starting to take the shape of my second brain. I just need to to start connecting the neurons and gray matter together. The screenshots, the essays, the bits and pieces i like, my to-do list, my email. Everything digital...

What a crazy time to be alive. The physical world might be the better place to build right now. I can't tell...

I do think that there is this short window of time where learning and becoming an expert on AI will pay dividends. The issue is that I need to tell the world how much I'm learning. The best way to do that is to provide others value. Is this the year i take X seriously and start a Vibe Coding Tips and Tricks (AI based) channel. I'm really liking building with AI and trying things, but maybe i'm not so interested becoming a teacher or learning about it in an academically rigorous matter. does that matter?

Again, so many thoughts and ideas and I think it's just a form of procrastination. Wishing everyone the best for 2026 and beyond.
