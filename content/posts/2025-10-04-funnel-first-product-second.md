excerpt: "My approach to building Dugout Edge: creating SEO content to gauge interest before developing the premium product."

This journal entry is going to be about building the funnel and then the product. Never got around to it, but that's how I'm approaching dugout edge. I'm building the content to rank on SEO first, gauging interest, then building the product if people start clicking. Had the lineup generator pages published and SEO optimized months before I had Dugout Edge Premium and payments setup. All i had to do was turn payments on.
