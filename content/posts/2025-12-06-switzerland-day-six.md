It's December 6th, 2025, and we've got two more days left on our Switzerland trip. It's a Saturday and I'm excited to go out and go to the discotheque with my new hoodie and just enjoy the time hanging out with my family. I wish every day was like vacation because it's just so chill and casual, but at the same time it's like the normalcy of your everyday routine contrasted with vacation makes vacation vacation.

I had a crazy dream last night that I threw up in the tomahawk soup that Nico bought for his party. It was in a bathtub and it was super embarrassing. That's all.

I had a hard time falling asleep last night. It's always the phone and the scrolling before bed. Makes the mind too active.

I'm starting to really think that I need to focus on one thing at a time. I either follow through with Dugout Edge or I start something else. Two entrepreneurial projects is almost a guaranteed way of knowing that both will fail.

I think I should keep building out Dugout Edge since I have momentum. I can build out the shells of fitnesscaps.com just so it's there, and maybe spruce up SpendMyStipend, but I think that should be it for this year.

Once I've completed the practice planner then I can reassess and start exploring other things, but one thing at a time.

New incoming ideas would be:

- Ecommerce
- LLM SEO
- Cha!
- Fitness hats

Goal for the next two days is to be present and enjoy time with family.
