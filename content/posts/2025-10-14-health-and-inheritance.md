Man, the craziest thing about journaling every single day is watching how fast time flies. It's been 45 days since I started, and it feels like it was just yesterday.

This morning, I had two thoughts. The first one: health is everything. My knee injury—whatever it ends up being, whether it's a partial tear or something less severe—has completely thrown me off. It's not even that bad compared to what some people go through, but it's crazy how much it's affected my mindset. I feel trapped, stuck inside, almost crippled. The last four or five days have been kind of depressing because I haven't been able to go outside, move, or do the things that make me feel alive. I can go to the gym, sure, but I'm in pain. I can only do upper body. I wanted to be running again, training full body, chasing goals—and now I'm sidelined.

It's a setback, no doubt. But what can you do? That's life. It really does show how important health and fitness are. There's nothing more valuable than waking up tomorrow—first, just waking up—and second, waking up healthy and able to move however you want. We take that for granted every single day. Being able to move your body freely, without pain, is one of life's most underrated blessings.

The second thought I had is completely unrelated: how important it is to understand where you come from. You know that saying, "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree." I think one of the best ways to understand your own strengths and weaknesses is to look at your parents. You might not turn out exactly like them, but you inherit a lot more than you realize—habits, tendencies, ways of thinking.

For example, my dad is extremely lazy. He doesn't like to put in the work, and I can see that in myself too. Deep down, I gravitate toward the easy path. My dad moved to Saudi Arabia, got a cushy job, basically napped through work, and made hundreds of thousands of dollars doing it. He ended up retiring a millionaire, with low stress and a simple life. And honestly? I get it. I'm doing something similar. It's not the worst thing in the world—it's smart in some ways. Low stress, good money. But it's also not maximizing potential. It's all about what you're optimizing for. Everyone's version of success looks different. In some ways, that kind of lifestyle is success. I actually admire it. But there's another part of me that wants more—more challenge, more purpose, more meaning.

Then there's my mom. She can be a little airheaded at times—sweet, but often in her own world. And I see that in myself too. I drift, I daydream, I don't always pay attention. Sometimes I wonder if it's because my mind's too active, always thinking ahead, or if I'm just a little bit spacey. From my dad, I get that "what's next" mindset—always planning the next move. From my mom, I get that floaty, distracted energy. It's a strange combination—always thinking forward, but sometimes forgetting what's right in front of me.

It's funny how hard it is to look inward and see yourself clearly. But it's so much easier to look at your parents and see their flaws—and realize you've inherited many of them. So if I had one takeaway from today, one piece of advice (even if it's just for myself), it's this:

If you want to understand yourself better, be critical of your parents. The traits that frustrate you in them are probably the same ones living inside you.
