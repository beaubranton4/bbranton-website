I love starting my day with a good workout. It makes me feel like a productive human being and then i'm ready to win the day. I've been listening a lot to the Y Combinator podcast. It's all stuff I've heard before, but what I do like is the takes from people who are closest to the frontier of advancements in AI and their perspectives on how to build a business around it.

I really keep wondering, am I missing out by not building an AI product? Is it really that big of an opportunity? I think the answer is yes, but what is stopping me? I'm not passionate about it? I think it will be too hard? Maybe i'm just not that interested in B2B.

I had a good idea for Dugout Edge - something related to having people put up flyers in Dugouts. I know! it was QR codes on the print outs that auto link to a coupon or a discount code for dugout edge. 

A viewer mode for players and parents maybe.
