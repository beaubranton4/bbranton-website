After 7 years, I finally had my first Christmas at the in-laws. It's nice to have a second family that has different traditions, different personalities, and different priorities. The family gatherings are mostly small talk and breathing sighs of reliefs when it comes game time or the Warriors game gets thrown on the TV, but it's never a bad time.

This morning I was scrolling through the 5 year stock charts as I'll often do and it is wild to think that it's been nearly 5 years since the 2020 monstrous tech highs that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. Most high flying tech stocks are still down, especially those that SPAC'd, but the ones that made it (in my mind) are the battle tested resilient tech businesses that aren't built around hype. I believe that these are the companies that will endure and ride the upcoming AI wave.

As an investor, these may not always give the best returns, but they are safest. 

My investment strategy is somewhere in between. I'm looking for these long term bullish trend and resilient stocks that are at a local minima, meaning they've been beaten down in the near term. In the zigs and the zags, the stock has been trending down, but if you zoom out, the stock has been trending up over the past 5-10 years. As long as there are no major headwinds to the business (like Gartner <> LLM's). Some of the names I like right now on this very day:

OKLO, NNE: Purely speculative based on the major headwinds of AI and the need for compute + the fact that they've lost 50% as the trading hype has died down. This is a short term selloff imo

NKE/LULU: Both these stocks are at 2018-2020 levels. They are household brands and signs of luxury. I think people have

NKE, LULU, UPWK, RH, COIN, MELI, ZS
