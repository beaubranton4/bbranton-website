I write early this morning in Lucerne as the family wakes up and gets ready for the day. Three months since my 30th birthday and I feel I've made very little progress towards my goals—although I know I've put countless hours thinking about what I need to do, building Dugout Edge, and researching new opportunities. Is it all a waste? Or will the fruits of labor only appear looking backwards? You can only connect the dots looking backwards as a wise man once said.

I still struggle daily with the paradox of choice having too many options available to me at any given time.

Will cleaning up my bad habits help with that? Getting off of social media? Maybe there are too many inputs and the only inputs I need are my own thoughts. There is a large part of me that thinks that living on X, or LinkedIn will provide me with valuable pieces of information on what to do and how to do it. Like a silver bullet that will instantly provide me with clarity on what to do.

There are also so many trends that I want to jump on. I think I'm good at spotting trends, but bad at capitalizing on them. I often know deep down that something needs to exist, and then a few years later it materializes in the world. I'm either tricking myself into believing I have good intuition, or I really do. Maybe everyone does, it's just that only 0.0001% ever act on it. Maybe when the trend is the perfect storm of my experiences, my skills, and who I am, is when I'll actually commit. I'm just being patient.

The hard part is that I'm really only supposed to pick one. So I need to make it perfect. Am I made for software? For content? For e-com? A physical storefront?

I think I'm starting to realize now and internalize that it's all just another form of entertainment. I am a kinesthetic learner which means I learn by doing. So I need to do. Consume less, create more. Only do.

Ikigai. Ikigai. Ikigai.

Just like sports, I think I need to try it all in order to know which I'm really good at. It will unveil itself. I just need to take more swings.

I have intimate knowledge and experience and am familiar with problems related to:

- Baseball
- Data
- Working Out
- Home Ownership/Renting
- Traveling
- Addiction
- Investing and Stock Trading

I am good at:

- Analysis
- Research
- Patience
- Writing
- Thinking in Systems
- Prompting LLMs
- SEO
- Risk Management
- Finance and Managing Money


I enjoy:

- Sports
- Games
- Fun
- Adventures
- Parties
- Travel
- Laughing
- Quality Time w Friends and Fam
- Trying new technology
- Building with Code

Things I can't stop thinking about:

- In person experiences like Academy Fall Camp
- How can I help baseball players/coaches collect data and use technology
- A new-age gym centered around sport and community
- I need to find partners and work with them
- Buying Back Time and applying Leverage via capital and labor
- Automation of:
    - Saving me money (shopping, credit card, reward programs)
    - Note taking, to-do list, journaling (consolidation and organization)

Halfway through our trip to Switzerland (4 more days). It's gone by way too fast. Going up another mountain today and going to spend a few hours at a wonderful spa. Looking forward to a nice relaxing time.
