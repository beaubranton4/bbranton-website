title: A Perfectly Chaotic Day

It's been a fun-filled 24 hours—one of those perfectly chaotic stretches that somehow feel both fleeting and full. From watching the World Series to Jiggits to 3 a.m. laughs, then waking up early to golf Stanford for Mike's birthday, and finally ending it all with dinner at Sukiya in Los Altos. It really was an ideal day: good food, good drinks, good music, good fun, dancing, laughter, and time spent with good friends. What more can you really ask for?

That said, I've got to admit—the drinking has to go. It's just wreaking havoc on my mind, body, and soul. Sure, it contributes to the fun, loosens things up, makes nights like this easy and memorable… but I'm getting a little too into it. I genuinely believe I can still experience all the same fun, all the same joy, without leaning on that liquid courage.

My knee, though… it's not doing great. I tried to convince myself it was feeling better, but after dancing all night and golfing all morning, it's definitely worse. Still swollen, still sore. I know I need to rest it. But in a weird way, today helped me figure out a few things—about my golf swing, at least. My grip, my setup, my ball striking—all of it's starting to make a little more sense. I think it comes down to being less mechanical, less overthought. Just trusting my body to move naturally. Being athletic instead of analytical.

I'll admit, sometimes when I'm out on the golf course, I think about life ending. Not in a dark way—more like this quiet, bittersweet awareness that time is limited. Maybe it's because I'm just enjoying the moment so much that I feel sad it can't last forever. It's strange, but that thought always seems to show up when I'm surrounded by beauty and calm.

Dinner at Sumika was incredible. I love yakitori—there's something about skewers and Japanese food that just feels right. I honestly think Japanese food might be the best in the world. The weekend overall has been full of temptation—food, drinks, staying out late—but those moments also tend to be the most fun. It's a real dilemma.

It was great seeing friends like Chao again. What an awesome, interesting human being. I'm grateful for these kinds of people and nights.

Now, though, it's time to rest. I had to tell the group I couldn't come out again tonight—the body's done for now. But it really was a great day: golf, dinner, drinks, laughter. I'm looking forward to a nice, relaxing, wholesome Sunday. Just taking it easy, resting, and recuperating.

At the end of the day, you only get a finite number of these moments—these fun, full, fleeting days—so it's worth making the most of them.
