Lately, I keep circling back to in-person businesses. Whenever I get bored, or when I want to decompress and reset, my instinct isn't to scroll my phone or sit inside—it's to go outside. Go for a bike ride. Head to the park. Hang out with people. There's something inherently joyful about play. Running around, moving, laughing. It feels good every single time. And I keep coming back to this idea: I want to help people play more. I want to build something that gets people out of their heads and into their bodies, moving and connecting.

Gyms come to mind immediately, but I think gyms are inherently broken. Millions of people pay $100 to $300 a month without question, just to go stand around for an hour, pick up some weights, maybe hop on a machine. From a business perspective, it's brilliant. Recurring revenue, relatively low overhead. But is it actually the best thing for people? What do people really want when they go to the gym? I don't think it's just the weights or the machines. It's the social interaction. It's the idea of having a "third place"—a destination you go to that isn't work or home. It's the ritual of showing up, seeing familiar faces, and telling yourself you're doing something good for your body.

And yes, most people probably are better off doing that than nothing. A bad workout is still better than sitting at home. But the deeper question nags at me: is there a "third place" I can create that delivers the same sense of belonging, but with more energy, more joy, more movement that feels natural? A space where people can be social if they want, take a class if they want, or just engage in something active, healthy, and fun.

Then my thoughts go to other experiences—like the Boca Juniors game. Being in that stadium was electric. It was a reminder that sometimes the most meaningful things we do are shared experiences in the real world. San Francisco is an incredible city for tourism. The energy, the views, the mix of neighborhoods—it's all here. So what could I build here? What kind of in-person business could take people around the city, give them something unforgettable, and let them tap into that same joy of play and connection? What's the most amazing thing about San Francisco—and how could I show it to people in a way they couldn't find on their own?

That's the thread I keep pulling at. It feels like there's something there. Something between health, movement, play, and shared experiences. Something that's not just good business, but also genuinely good for people.

Which leads me to part two—what I actually want out of life.

I want to spend more of my time playing. I want to spend more of my time moving, thinking, having fun. When I think back to my childhood, the things I loved most weren't complicated: recess, playing outside with my friends, skating around town, hanging out late at night, watching funny videos. That's what felt alive. That's what filled me with joy.

So how do I want to live? I want to wake up every day excited. To get outside, to move, to be with other people. To just have a good time, laugh, joke around. I don't want anything to be too serious. But I do like a little bit of competition—whether that's sports or games. I really do love that part about baseball.

What I desire is unlimited time to do what I please. To experience new things. To travel, to adventure. Maybe something that can take me all over the world. I want to impact people to be healthy, to be active. To enjoy the sun, to enjoy the presence of other people. To play games, to play sport. Sport is universal, it's inherent to all of us.

I think it's my mission to spread that.

The prospect of adventure excites me—like starting a Pokémon journey.
