Skipped the last two days because of Portola, so here's a quick recap. It was tons of fun. No dopamine left in the tank—but such a good time hanging out with friends, listening to great music, and dancing. Always a blast, but it does kind of suck to lose an entire weekend. In the moment, the days after feel wasted, but in reality, those are the good times I'll remember forever.

Outside of Portola, I've been thinking a lot about starting something on social media and really trying to build a following. I truly believe it's the fastest, most efficient way to build wealth right now, and honestly one of the easiest. My instinct is always to build and build—products, tools, projects—because that's what I'm comfortable with. What I'm not comfortable with is putting myself out there, marketing myself, selling myself. But the truth is, that's what I need to be doing.

I keep seeing kids blow up to half a million followers just by documenting their journey—whether it's building a pickleball court or launching a luxury wellness Airbnb. No doubt, they're good at content, but the real difference is that they took the risk. They just started. If it hits, it hits. If it doesn't, nobody cares, you keep trying. And the whole time they're building a skill—storytelling, creating content—arguably one of the most valuable assets in the world today. Attention is currency, and the ability to own it is powerful.

At the same time, I love building. It's fun, it's satisfying, and I'm getting better at it. Plus, it has a different kind of payoff—you can build something once, and it can keep paying dividends without needing constant publishing, marketing, and selling. Maybe there's a way to merge the two. If I can build something that automates content creation, that could be the key. A way to keep the engine going without burning out, while still learning how to storytell and capture attention.

On the other hand, sometimes I feel like I just need to think of the absolute coolest thing I could possibly be doing with my time. If I only get one life—and I do—and if I couldn't fail—and in some ways, I can't—then what would that thing be? I think that's what I need to be chasing.
