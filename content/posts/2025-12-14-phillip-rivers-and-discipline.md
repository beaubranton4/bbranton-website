Phillip Rivers got me thinking about making a comeback.

Had a fun night doing White elephant at Mike and Erin's. Also kind of funny/cool to think a YC founder invited us. Definitely a bad weekend when it comes to discipline. It's a bad habit - being super disciplined on the weekdays, and having 0 boundaries on the weekends. The bad habits snowball, and I can feel it. I think sometimes it's ok to give in, but then it just never stops. 

I find myself in the habit of "I'll do it tomorrow" and that one saying is, I think, the root of a lot of my unhappiness. It is not that i'm unhappy overall. But whenever i'm displeased with myself it normally stems from this. Lack of discipline. And it is not necessarily the direct result of lack of discipline that is the issue. Skipping the gym one day or a few days will not kill me. But, it deters my self-confidence in myself. It taints my self-image.

Improvement in self confidence may be the most important byproduct of discipline
