# MVP Development: Testing Your Funnel First

I wanted to write about what is better than an MVP or how to really develop an MVP. It matters on your product and then it matters on how you're going to get customers. What you want to do is test that marketing or sales funnel. That should be your first step.

## The Core Principle

**Test your funnel before you build your product.** If you're going to get customers via social media marketing, say you're a D2C product like a shirt or a hat, you probably want to test your designs on social media first. That should be your first step before doing anything else. The bare minimum is testing that funnel and seeing if there's interest in it.

## Product-Specific Approaches

**Informational Products:**
- Start by writing a few articles
- Put them on a website
- See if people are clicking
- Test the SEO funnel

**B2B SaaS Products:**
- Before you build the SaaS, don't build the product first
- Reach out to 20 founders in the industry asking if they'd be interested in a conversation
- You need to test the funnels that you're going to use once you actually do have a product

## The Key Insight

You need to test the funnels that you're going to use once you actually do have a product. Don't build first, test your acquisition channel first.
