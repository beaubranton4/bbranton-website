I'm on my way back from Switzerland to SF. The past 48 hours have been rainy, but honestly it felt like the perfect ending to a perfect family vacation. We drank a little too much Saturday night out in Zurich after an amazing Swiss dinner at Zum Königstuhl. I had the Zürcher Geschnetzeltes—a famous Swiss dish—and loved it. It was like a creamy beef stroganoff paired with a perfectly crisped hash brown. We split a bottle of Swiss wine and walked around the streets of Zurich afterward. It's safe to say I am officially Christmas-marketed out.

We went to a beer hall with Kenji and Tiana and ended up sitting outside. It was chilly, but it worked out perfectly because a (Swiss?) mariachi band parked themselves right across from us and played for the next hour while we played cards. We played a game I know as "Bomb," though Kenji had a different name for it.

We capped off the night at a pub where we played "Essence" and the number game.

The last day was a bit of a hungover slog, but it worked out since all we had planned was the Lindt Chocolate Factory tour. We also saw people participating in a Swiss tradition where they swim across the river wearing Santa hats in sub-zero temps.

Lindt was a dope experience—really well designed and surprisingly automated. The in-person experience required almost no human labor. The translation and guided tour ran through a remote control, and even the chocolate distribution was automated like it was hand sanitizer. Unlimited chocolate until we were sick. The white chocolate was my favorite.

Pockets have been emptied, but I'm so thankful and grateful for this time. Now back to reality…
