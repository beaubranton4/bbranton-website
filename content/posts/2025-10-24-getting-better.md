Finally starting to feel better health-wise. After what must've been a nine or ten-day stretch of sickness, I'm finally on the mend. My knee's also feeling ten times better than it used to—I actually jogged on it for the first time at the gym today. That alone is such a good sign that nothing's seriously wrong with it, and I can probably start easing back into my normal workout routine soon. It'll still be a week or two before I'm doing full lower body workouts like squats, but I think I can start adding in some light running, jogging, and cardio.

It's such a strong reminder of how important health is—physical, mental, all of it. It's funny, there's physical health, but then there's also this separate category of body health—the systems that keep you functioning: your immune system, your joints, your nervous system. They all play different roles, but they're so interconnected. When one of them's off, it can throw everything else off too.

I came across a tweet this morning about how "building in public" is kind of a scam—basically just a big Twitter echo chamber. And honestly, I don't doubt it. I think there are people for whom it's valuable, but most of the ones who seem to succeed with it are those building tools for entrepreneurs, because that's who lives on Twitter. If your audience isn't other builders, it's harder to see how that strategy really pays off. It's starting to feel like it might make more sense to just build a social media following for the actual company instead of trying to build around myself as an entrepreneur.

I keep oscillating between those two paths. The whole "build in public" thing doesn't quite feel like me—it's like I'm trying to put on a voice that isn't mine. When I tweet, it doesn't sound natural. Maybe I just need to lean into being myself, or maybe that whole approach just doesn't fit who I am. I think I'd be better off focusing on making funny, authentic content while still talking about what I'm building in a way that feels more like me.

I keep thinking that if I started a content series about building a hat company, people would actually be interested—it's physical, it's tangible, it's something cool people can see and relate to. But if I do it about a lineup generator, it's just not as engaging. People aren't as interested in something that feels niche or overly technical. They want something they can touch, wear, or imagine themselves using in real life.

Overall, though, I've been feeling really good lately—clearer mentally, sharper. Getting more sleep always helps, but I think it's also the small daily decisions: eating healthy, staying consistent, taking care of myself. All those things compound. I just need to keep going. Keep the snowball rolling. Because once you stop, it melts—and you have to start all over again. So: let compounding compound.
