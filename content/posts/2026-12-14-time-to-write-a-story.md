The story of the day was waking up early to hike diamond head with mom. It's right in our backyard, but I haven't done it since I was a kid and never with my mom. No sunrise today, it was overcast and we got a heavy dose of showers on the way down, but a very meaningful morning to me.

There is so much value sitting on the internet today in the form of knowledge, philosophical thought pieces, how to guides, stories of human peril, etc..

The issue is that our brains don't absorb digital experiences like it does in person experiences. What I mean by that is that in today's technological climate, if you want to call it that, we spend maybe half of the day on our phones. Call it six hours a day, spread between different apps, social media, consuming hundreds of bits and pieces of information, especially on a feed like Twitter, you're consuming 100 different posts a day. Instagram, looking at hundreds of reels, thousands of pictures. And the issue is that our mind starts to discount all of these because we see them so frequently in the same form that it's hard for our brains to pick up the signal from the noise. And so I think that bookmarking, saving things into a click bank, utilizing a digital technology tool like Eden can be very helpful for these sorts of things. But the truth is, all of these bits of knowledge are meaningless unless they're put into practice and applied in your daily life. Or maybe not your daily life, but in some way, shape or form, it needs to change you. And that is where I notice that, right, I might see something, a bit of advice on Twitter such as Wake Up early. But that kind of just falls dead in the echo chambers of social media.

I'm much more likely to start waking up early before the sun rises due to a good friend telling me that they've started doing it and been seeing an impact or a mentor or maybe even a speaker. Because I think our brains really internalize these messages from real experiences and have started to become desensitized to the messages relayed to us over forms of digital mediums.
