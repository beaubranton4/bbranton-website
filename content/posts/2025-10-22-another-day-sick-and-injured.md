Pretty standard day of work today — didn’t do too much. Still feeling pretty sick, honestly. I’ve got jury duty tomorrow, where I’ll find out if I’ve been selected for a case or not. Honestly, I don’t think it would be the worst thing in the world if I did get picked. It could be a cool experience — being part of the judicial system, seeing how it all works firsthand. Plus, I’d get to miss work for a bit, so that’s not too bad either.

Something that’s been on my mind lately: I think I need to let myself be a little more bored. I’ve been realizing how much I rely on constant inputs — social media, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, reading — and while all of those are great for learning, they can also drown out my own thoughts. I want more time to synthesize, to let ideas settle, and to think deeply about them. It’s one thing to consume, but another to truly process. I feel like too often, the thoughts running through my head aren’t even mine — they’re just echoes of other people’s opinions. I want to recalibrate a bit and figure out what I genuinely think, what my brain naturally drifts toward, and what I truly care about.

That reminds me of a quote from Naval — or at least a paraphrased version of one: “The less you care about something, the better you’ll do it.” The idea being that when you stop forcing things and let yourself act naturally, your best self tends to come out. I saw that firsthand during my senior year in baseball. That was the year I kind of gave up caring so much — I stopped gripping the bat so tight, mentally and literally — and that’s when everything clicked. I started hitting nearly .400 and eventually got drafted. There’s definitely truth in that balance between detachment and flow.

And honestly, I know I use social media as a form of procrastination. It’s a way to feel productive or stimulated without actually doing anything meaningful. I could definitely do better there.

I’ve also been thinking a lot about focus — honing in on what I’m actually good at and where my strengths intersect. That’s probably why I keep coming back to baseball. It’s what I know best. I’ve made it to the highest level short of the majors, and I understand the game deeply. Combine that with my comfort in tech and AI, and there’s something there. Maybe I should lean even further into that overlap — find ways to connect baseball and data. There’s a whole world of analytics and insight in sports that still feels untapped in some ways. If I could build something that bridges those two worlds — baseball and data — I think that would be my sweet spot.
