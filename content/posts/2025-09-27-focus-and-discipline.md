excerpt: "Reflecting on the importance of focus and avoiding shiny object syndrome while getting back into running."

Today I had a nice long run — six miles. I'm trying to get back into running in a more structured way for the first time since my marathon. I've gone out here and there, but I'd like to follow a disciplined plan again. My big goal is to hit 10 miles at a 7:30 pace. It feels pretty ambitious right now, but I'm excited about the challenge and the idea of mixing running back into my training routine alongside lifting.

What's really been on my mind today, though, is the topic of focus. Lately I've been thinking about how shiny object syndrome has been holding me back from reaching my full potential. When you try to do everything at once, it's almost impossible to succeed. There's definitely value in following curiosity, chasing passions, and experimenting, but when it comes to building a company, it's probably better to focus on one thing and go all in, rather than trying to do too many things halfway.

The truth is, you can't do everything at a high level without serious leverage—whether that's capital, labor, or code. And right now, I don't really have that. What I'm realizing is that even building one seemingly simple product has taken so much time, energy, and skill. Maybe part of it is my lack of programming experience, or maybe it's just the difficulty of maintaining deep focus, but the reality is: this stuff takes time.

Using the drilling metaphor, I've been poking around in different directions—writing articles, covering the Little League World Series, experimenting with bats, social media, even considering forums. All of that might be valuable down the line, but what I really need to do right now is drill straight down into the core: building products and getting customers. Specifically, I need to target coaches of teams ages 6 through 12—the volunteers who don't know much about baseball but want to give their kids a great experience. That's who I need to serve right now.

Sure, there will be time to branch out later. I can experiment and wander a little off the beaten path. But starting a hat company or buying a batting cage isn't going to get me closer to my long-term vision unless I fully pivot. And I don't want to pivot. I've got something that's working, something I care about, and now the answer is simple: double down, triple down, lock in. Focus.
