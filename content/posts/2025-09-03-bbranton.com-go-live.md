On the eve of my 30th birthday, I decided to vibe code and launch this website, bbranton.com. A website dedicated to none other than - me. I'm a little salty that beaubranton.com was taken by some guy from Maryland. He seems like a good guy though, so no hard feelings.

I've been wanting to do this for a while now to document just things I've been working on and to have a place to share my thoughts, to share my experiences and just have a digital footprint really. I want to make it a challenge to write 500 words a day. I'm actually not writing them. I'm typically just speaking them and editing and revising with a little bit of help from AI, smiley face. But I thought that this website would be a good place to serve as a ledger for those sorts of activities. After all, life is short and it would be great for my kids to have a place to see all that their dad or granddad or great-great-great-great-granddad was thinking about and doing in the off chance that I become something one day.
