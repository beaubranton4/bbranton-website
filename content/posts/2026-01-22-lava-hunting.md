Touched down on the Big Island for some lava hunting. Episode 41 of Kilauea erupting is expected between January 23-25 and we are right on the money to catch towering lava fountains shoot out from the earth. A once in a lifetime opportunity.

We landed around 8 o'clock p.m. Picked up the Turo, a 2023 Toyota Tacoma (lifted yotaaaa) and drove to the Airbnb. As soon as we got there, I checked the livestream and we could see some actual spattering and a fair bit of lava. We debated for a bit, but ended up making the 10 minute drive around 11pm to check it out. And I'm so glad we did. Even though these were just precursory spatters, the sounds, the vibes, the stillness of a dozen people watching fire spout from the crust of the earth. So cool.

At least they're mesmerized for about an hour. I can't imagine what an actual episode would be like! What a thrill.

I built a little bot that checks the USGS Kilauea volcano alerts every 30 seconds and both plays an audible notification and pushes a phone notification as soon as it happens. It went off in the airport and seems to be working pretty well.

I'm also noticing that the more volcanic activity, the more livestream viewership.

Could be a fun little project to build into. Help people view the lava fountaining at Kilauea. The problem is that once these eruptions stop, it's impossible to tell when they'll pick back up.

Apparently before the first eruptions about a year ago in December 2024, it had been 40 years since these sorts of lava fountaining episodes had taken place.

On another note, the Airbnb we're staying at is absolutely gorgeous, tucked away in all the foliage of the Hawaiian landscape. Just minutes away from Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Beautiful koa wood. Nice lanai. Just really clean. Kind of reminds me like of a house in Tahoe. Kind of like that vibe. I would love to own one like this. I just don't know if it's prime location outside of these lava fountaining episodes, which like I just mentioned might only last for a few more months and then never come back.
