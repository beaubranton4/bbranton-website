It's November 28th, 2025, day after Thanksgiving, and I'm headed to Switzerland today. Really excited for family vacation, to see a new country, and to experience life.

Woke up early this morning to try and diminish the effects of jet lag when I land. So the plan is to stay up. Flight's at 4:00 PM, woke up really early, so I'll be tired by the time the flight hits. Two or four hours in, I'll sleep for six, seven hours. Wake up, it'll be... well, noon there. Landing in Copenhagen, flight from Copenhagen to Switzerland, about four hours, we'll land around 4:30 and then training to Interlaken, so we need to stay up that entire time. And hopefully I'll be tired by the time we get in.

I woke up early, started working on my projects. Started working on projects last night. I think it's inevitable at this point. I can't deny the fact that I love building these things, these projects that I've been working on. Shot to go. Thank you. Dugout Edge. Why else would I be working on them? Thanksgiving at 11:00 PM at night. Okay. I'm kind of hooked.

And so if I'm going to take this thing seriously, there are certain things that I know that I need to do. I need to brush up on my skills that I'm uncomfortable working on. Like obviously I can sit behind a computer and talk to cloud code and tell it to do things all day, all night, but in order for me to succeed, I'm going to need to learn how to market. I'm going to learn how to sell. I need to learn more about design and marketing and branding and social media. Thank you. Either that or I need to learn how to hire, or I need to find a co-founder, or co-founders.

That's why I think I'm excited about Cha2Go (cha2go.com). Because I can clearly see a path where a partnership with Thomas would be mutually beneficial for both of us, where I have more of the systems design thinking, the operational skills, the business, the financial and the analytical skills and he's got more of the creative brain, maybe more of the vision, and can help with the marketing and the content creation. The only thing I'm not sure about is if I'm passionate about the product of Asian tea. Now I do love tea and I do think that the world needs a healthy alternative and a fun brand. I really just need to focus on those sorts of things though.

Same with Dugout Edge. If I keep going at the pace that I'm going, you know, I can get there, but it's going to take me forever. I think that I need to pull some levers. And I think the levers that I have to pull are, you know, deploy more capital to buy back time. I think I'm willing to do that at this point. I think I can safely spend at least $5,000 to $10,000. So maybe that's Cloud Code Max subscription. Maybe that's hiring someone to do the building for me. Maybe that is just hiring, you know, a VA from the Philippines to source drills for me, add drills. But either way, I think at this pace, it's going too slow. I need to expand instead of just continuing to do the things that I'm good at, which is SEO, building, thinking systematically, which has been great for this project and all of my projects so far, but I think that I can only get so far going at this speed and at this pace and I need a new unlock.

Gosh, I really wish every morning I could just wake up and work on what I wanted. Go to the gym. Get my workout in. Eat healthy, live healthy, and just do what I want. Just be free to explore. I really do miss the days when, you know, I love baseball and I woke up and I dreamt about it, I slept it, I did it. And I was fine just doing it for the sake of doing it. And it led me to success. And so I need to take that framework and apply that to, you know, whatever else my new passion is, and maybe that is building businesses. Maybe it's something else, but I'm excited to find out.

On another note, I came across two personal portfolio websites that I thought were really cool:

- [portfolioshub.com](https://portfolioshub.com)
- [alanagoyal.com](https://alanagoyal.com)

I can use these as inspiration for my own personal website, which is really coming together. It's informal. It's something that I can easily post to daily using this format of leveraging AI and voice technology. But I would like to be able to showcase myself a little bit better. I don't think the website's there yet in terms of truly painting a picture of who I am and painting it in a positive light. I don't think anyone that looks at my website now will be very impressed. I'd like to change that. I am quite glad that I started this thing and I've built momentum with it.

Random thought here, but I think that is one thing that I'm really good at is not procrastinating. I'm able to start a project and just work on it for 20 minutes, 30 minutes, take a break, come back two days later, put in an hour, come back one week later, put in five minutes, one day later five minutes, one day later five minutes. Like I'm able to just... I don't know. I feel like I'm able to plan out things just instinctively based on, you know, just thinking hey, I should do this and then I go and do it. Which is why I'm going to build fitnesscaps.com next. I think planning five years in advance for when I launch my head company, it will really pay dividends to have this kind of SEO, this site that's built domain authority. So I do think that building out these websites will pay dividends and will allow me to own my skills and allow me to build my portfolio of websites.

I just want to make sure it's not wasting time and just detracting from my true efforts. Maybe my true efforts aren't to make as much money as possible. Maybe it's to learn as much as possible, to build as much as possible, and just put feelers out there into the world and see what hits. But I do think that I'm going down the right track and so as long as I'm having fun, I think that is going down the right track. And so again, sorry redundant saying this millions of times, but I'm on the right track.
