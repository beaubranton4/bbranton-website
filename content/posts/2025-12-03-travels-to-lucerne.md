Today we traveled from Interlaken to Lucerne by train. It was a little bit foggy so I didn't quite get to see all the beautiful scenery, but nonetheless, it was a new and memorable experience. We played the numbers game which always passes the time well.

Lucerne is a wonderful city. As soon as you step off the train you can feel how grand and magnificent the city is. It has a historic, yet beautifully clean and modern feel. The lake or river? I'm still not sure—runs through the heart and provides a central life force for the urban landscape. With temperatures right around 32 degrees (Fahrenheit), it truly feels like Christmas.

The magic happened when the lights turned on and the sun went down around 4:30. We had an excellent Italian meal full of laughs. Walked around some more and stumbled upon some great food stalls at a Christmas market.

Excited for a nice spa day tomorrow.
