Today is Portola, and I'm super excited. I'm thankful for the little things that make life better—gooseneck kettles, beer-ba-mate, and good-fitting shirts. I feel confident, fun, and joyful.

My intention for today is to be present, to make people laugh, and to really live in the moment. Life comes at you fast, and I want to soak it all in. Four years of Portola—wow. Crazy to think about. We'll see what happens, but I'm ready to embrace whatever the day brings.

Last night, I didn't sleep super well—probably from what I took before bed. My mind kept spinning on the SEO change I made. I rerouted my lineup generator to a new URL. It used to live on the home page, but now it's its own page at "/lineup-generator." The long-term plan is for lineup generator to build authority and rank on its own, while the home page becomes its own separate landing spot for everything else.

I think I did a good job with the technical side—using AI to help with the redirects, making sure the default URL forwards properly, and structuring it so Google will hopefully reward the change. I even tried to manually index the new setup, so we'll see what happens.
