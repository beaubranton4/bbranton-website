Here's a business idea. Let's build a brand-new computer—a computer that you just speak to. No mouse. No keyboard. That's it. No clicking. No typing. No trackpad. You just talk.

We've officially reached the point where you can build almost anything you can imagine just by speaking it out loud. That still feels surreal to write. You can describe a tool, a system, an app, an idea—and it can come to life. You don't need to know how to code. You don't need a giant team. You don't even need that much time. The friction between idea and execution has basically collapsed.

And yet, somehow, that hasn't solved the real problem.

The real problem is that people don't know what to build.

Inside companies right now, there's this constant drumbeat: "We need AI agents." Everyone is being told to create them. Build automations. Build copilots. Build internal tools. Speed things up. Reduce headcount. Increase efficiency. But when you actually stop and ask the simple question—what does that mean?—things get quiet.

Yes, there are processes that can be automated. Yes, there are workflows that can be streamlined. Yes, you can build systems that reduce the time it takes to close out tasks or move things from point A to point B. But the deeper issue isn't time. It's clarity.

It's direction.

It's taste.
