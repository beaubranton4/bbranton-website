The date is November 16th, 2025. Sunday. Really fun weekend with friends. Went to encasements Friday night and hung out in the Mission, got a Boosties. Saturday night went to Camp's housewarming. Then hung out at Alex and Giovi's house. Again, really just too much drinking, but it's also so darn fun.

At a crossroads here. One of our other friends is doing a half month sober on everything. Two years off of nicotine. Six months off of hard stuff. In any case, a little bit of a waste of a weekend outside of the social aspect, but you pick and choose your battles.

It's been all day hanging out at the mall, got sand tongued today. Finally got my Uniqlo pants hemmed correctly, bought a nice down jacket from there. And yeah, there's still a little bit of shopping, but really not super productive. That's okay. Just live in life, enjoy the moments.

Hopefully I can get a lot of work done trying to release a practice planner before I head off to Switzerland for Thanksgiving. Oh yeah, and of course, celebrating Abby getting a new job! She signed with Anrok on Friday and will start mid-December. Stoked for her — second job out of college and for a new chapter in her life.
