**Written by AI**

Three months ago, I turned 30. At the time, I was sitting at roughly $XXX-XXXK net worth, working a remote job I genuinely enjoyed, and tinkering with Dugout Edge on the side. I had all the ingredients for contentment, yet I felt restless. That restlessness—that constant hum of "there's more to do, more to build, more to figure out"—defined my Q4.

This retrospective is my attempt to make sense of it all. To distill three months of daily journaling, building, failing, recovering, and thinking into something actionable. If you're reading this, you're probably me in six months, looking back to see if I followed through.

## What I Accomplished

### October: Building Through Pain

October tested me physically in ways I didn't expect. A knee injury from soccer had me genuinely worried about ACL damage, followed by a 9-10 day illness that knocked out my productivity and mood entirely. But the month wasn't a loss.

**Dugout Edge Progress:**
- Built and published the drill library with visual content and video URLs
- Created an email automation system with segmented templates for different user journey stages (churning users, free trial non-starters, trial endings)
- Restructured the practice plans page architecture from individual category pages to a consolidated searchable library
- Got my first free trial signup in 10 days after removing a "scammy" feature request banner that was killing trust
- Maintained $120 MRR—flat, but stable

**Personal Wins:**
- Attended Stanford baseball alumni gathering, reconnecting with 15-20 people including multiple MLB players
- Started experimenting with Meta Ray-Ban glasses for content capture
- Completed jury duty (not glamorous, but adulting nonetheless)

The biggest shift in October was mental. I found myself pulling away from tech bubble culture—the obsession with ARR, scale, blitzscale. I realized I was trying to build for an abstract online audience when my real energy came from solving problems for people I actually knew. By month's end, I'd committed to building for my world, not the internet's version of it.

### November: Joy as Oxygen

November brought a philosophical breakthrough that reframed everything: **joy is the oxygen for hard things.**

I'd been chasing outputs—MRR numbers, feature completions, signup counts. But I realized I admired Warren Buffett not because he's a billionaire, but because he spends his days reading financial statements. The input is the reward. Without joy at the end of a difficult effort, we burn out.

**Building Momentum:**
- Dugout Edge continued performing well enough to likely rank in the top 100 on indie hacker MRR sites
- Launched Cha2Go (cha2go.com)—an Asian tea marketplace idea I'd been sitting on
- Developed a framework for building websites with AI agents in 3-4 hours instead of 50-60 hours
- Documented a comprehensive AI-assisted web development blueprint

**Personal Growth:**
- Established consistent journaling, approaching 100 days by month's end
- Renewed commitment to physical fitness after recognizing that sitting all day was giving me "floppy fin syndrome" like captive orcas
- Created a new workout framework: aesthetics 2x/week, athleticism 2x/week, cardio 2x/week, daily mobility work

November also surfaced a painful SEO mistake: I'd accidentally added a no-index tag to Dugout Edge's lineup generator during a homepage redirect. Traffic tanked. Signups dropped from 30 in September to single digits. It was a gut punch, but also a lesson in the fragility of organic traffic and the importance of testing changes before pushing to production.

### December: Strategic Clarity

December was transformative. It started with a week-long family trip to Switzerland—Interlaken, Lucerne, Zurich. Standing on Mt. Rigi, looking out at the Alps, was one of the best days of my life. The physical distance from daily pressures created space for deeper questions: What am I made for? What's my ikigai?

**Product Development:**
- Built a WYSIWYG editor for the practice planner feature
- Created 200+ drills library for baseball/softball
- Developed 30+ customizable practice plan templates
- Learned hard lessons about deployment when I accidentally pushed unfinished code to production (customer Sean Wyder kindly pointed it out)

**Personal Milestones:**
- Completed a 10-day streak of clean living post-Switzerland—no alcohol, no scrolling, early mornings. The productivity and clarity during this window were remarkable.
- First Christmas at in-laws (navigating new family dynamics)
- Crystallized 2026 goals with actual specificity

The competitive landscape also shifted. Gamechanger announced they're building lineup generation features—Dugout Edge's primary differentiator. Rather than panic, it motivated me to expand faster. The practice planner needs to ship. Distribution needs to scale.

## What I Spent the Most Time Thinking About

### The Paradox of Choice

This quarter, I generated dozens of business ideas. Hat companies. Tea brands. Lead generation for local businesses. ChatGPT mini-apps. AI analytics tools for indie hackers. Every shiny object caught my attention.

But I kept returning to the same conclusion: **two entrepreneurial projects is a guaranteed path to failure.** The tension between portfolio thinking (multiple passive income streams) and singular focus (one thing done well) resolved itself through repeated failure to make progress on anything when I tried to do everything.

The constraint isn't ideas. It's execution bandwidth. One project at a time until it's done or deliberately killed.

### Discipline as the Root Habit

December crystallized something I'd been circling all quarter: discipline is the foundational habit that unlocks everything else.

When I exercise in the morning, I eat better. When I eat better, I have more energy. When I have more energy, I build more. When I build more, I feel accomplished. When I feel accomplished, I sleep better. The virtuous cycle compounds.

But it works in reverse too. Skip a workout, feel sluggish, reach for sugar, stay up late scrolling, wake up tired, skip the next workout. Bad habits stack faster than good ones.

The phrase that roots much of my unhappiness: **"I'll do it tomorrow."**

### Joy as the Oxygen for Hard Things

I spent years optimizing for outcomes I thought I should want. But this quarter, I started asking different questions: What actually gives me dopamine? What work would I do even if no one paid me?

The answer kept coming back to building things that help people and making them laugh. Not abstract scale. Not impressive metrics. Just... being useful and bringing some levity.

Outputs matter less than inputs. If I don't enjoy the daily work, no outcome will satisfy me. This reframing—admiring the work, not just the results—changed how I evaluate opportunities.

### Building for My World

Somewhere in October, I realized I was building for strangers on the internet while neglecting the 30 people I actually care about. Tech Twitter had convinced me that "scale" was the goal, but my best energy came from solving problems for coaches I knew, friends who needed websites, family members with questions.

The shift: build for my world first. If it scales, great. If it doesn't, at least I helped people I actually know.

### Agentic Systems and the Future of Software

The technical rabbit hole of December was agentic AI. Claude Code, Cursor, and similar tools succeed because they maintain context graphs—the reasoning behind decisions, not just the outputs.

This got me thinking: what does software look like when it's designed for agents to use? If AI agents are running 24/7, they'll need tools too. The question "How do agents discover software?" might be as important as "How do humans discover software?" in five years.

I'm not building in this space yet, but I'm watching it closely. Distribution will always beat product, even in an agentic world.

## Key Learnings

Eight insights I want to carry into 2026:

1. **Test your funnel before building your product.** For D2C, test designs on social media first. For informational products, write the article and test SEO before building features. For B2B SaaS, reach out to 20 potential customers before writing code.

2. **Create before you consume.** The first hour of my day should be creative work, not podcasts or Twitter. Inputs shape outputs.

3. **Write 5 ideas daily.** Jesse Cole's framework. Most ideas are bad. But the muscle of generating them reveals patterns and occasionally surfaces gold.

4. **Inputs affect outputs.** What I consume shapes what I create. Garbage in, garbage out. Curate ruthlessly.

5. **Work smarter, not harder.** "A donkey works harder than the rest of us, but it ain't rich." Capital, strategy, and operational excellence beat pure effort.

6. **Don't use planning as procrastination.** Listening to podcasts about building businesses is not building a business. Action beats consumption.

7. **Health is foundational.** October proved this. Can't build anything when you're injured and sick. Protect the body first.

8. **Slow mornings set the tone.** Journaling, intention-setting, no reactive scrolling. The first 30 minutes determine the next 12 hours.

## Struggles and Challenges

### Health

The knee injury in October scared me. I spent two weeks genuinely worried about ACL damage. It healed, but the fear lingered. Then the 9-10 day illness wiped out my momentum entirely.

November brought hip and SI joint pain—likely compensation from the old knee injury. Swimming and running made it worse. I'm still working on biomechanics and mobility.

The pattern is clear: I'm 30 now. My body doesn't recover like it used to. Preventive maintenance isn't optional anymore.

### Business

The SEO mistake hurt. Watching signups drop from 30 to single digits because of a no-index tag I accidentally left on felt like amateur hour. The lesson: test everything, trust nothing, verify deployments.

The accidental production push of unfinished features in December was embarrassing. Single-branch development doesn't work when you're trying to ship small fixes around large WIP features. I need a better branching strategy.

And Gamechanger building lineup features? That's a real threat. They have distribution I'll never match. The only answer is to move faster and differentiate on practice planning.

### Mental

Shiny object syndrome plagued the entire quarter. Every podcast surfaced a new idea that seemed better than what I was working on. The discipline to stay focused on Dugout Edge—even when it felt like slow progress—was genuinely hard.

Three months past 30, I sometimes feel behind. Friends are having kids, getting promoted, buying houses. I'm tinkering with a baseball app that makes $120/month. The comparison trap is real.

But when I zoom out, I see the progress. Consistent journaling. Growing technical skills. Clearer thinking about what I want. The metrics aren't there yet, but the foundation is stronger.

## The Through-Line

If I had to summarize Q4 2025 in one sentence: **I went from scattered exploration to strategic clarity.**

The clarity:
- **Dugout Edge is the canvas.** One project until it's done or deliberately killed.
- **Discipline is the foundational habit.** Everything else cascades from showing up consistently.
- **Joy is the fuel.** If I don't enjoy the work, no outcome will satisfy me.
- **Build for my world.** The 30 people I know matter more than 30,000 strangers.

## 2026 Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Dugout Edge: $1K MRR.** This is the single business metric that matters. Everything else is noise until this happens.

2. **Workout done by 8am.** In bed by 10pm. Morning exercise sets the tone for everything else. Non-negotiable.

3. **Find a regular weekly sport or community.** I miss playing. Basketball, soccer, something. Weekly commitment with people I like.

4. **Find an entrepreneur community and participate actively.** I've been building in isolation. That's a mistake. I need peers who understand the journey.

5. **No bad habits.** Same boundaries on weekends as weekdays. The weekend discipline breaks kill Monday momentum.

6. **Whole foods focus.** Less salt, less sugar, more real food. Not a diet—a lifestyle.

### Secondary Goals

7. **Slow heartbeat mornings.** Meditation or intentional breathing before reaching for the phone.

8. **Hang out with friends once a week.** Relationships atrophy without maintenance.

9. **Find a hobby with hands.** Physical creation, not just digital. Woodworking, cooking, something tactile.

10. **Write down problems, not just ideas.** Problems are more valuable than solutions without context.

11. **12 new experiences.** One per month. Travel, classes, events—anything outside routine.

12. **Get rejected 356 times.** Applications, outreach, networking. Rejection is evidence of trying.

### Guiding Principles

- **Distribution 50% / Product 50%.** Building alone isn't enough. Half my energy goes to getting it in front of people.
- **Create before consume.** First hour is for making, not absorbing.
- **One project until it's done.** No new ventures until Dugout Edge hits $1K MRR or I deliberately kill it.
- **Discipline as the root habit.** Everything else follows from showing up.
- **Build for people I know.** Solve problems for my world first.

## Closing

Q4 2025 wasn't what I expected. I didn't hit the metrics I wanted. I got injured, got sick, made embarrassing mistakes, and wrestled with doubt about whether any of this was worth it.

But I also clarified what matters. I found my canvas. I established habits that compound. I learned that joy isn't a reward for hard work—it's the fuel that makes hard work sustainable.

The retrospective is done. Now it's time to paint.

Here's to 2026.
