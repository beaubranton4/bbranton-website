Real workouts have a cognitive cost; need to plan around the energy dip. Dugout Edge limbo: know I should do marketing, content, video—but building feels like play, marketing feels boring.

Had a pretty good day so far. I started the morning with a workout, got a little bit of work done, then rode through Golden Gate Park and took a nap. Came back, got more work done. It's funny because I probably worked a little more than I wanted to, but the workday isn't even technically over and I already have these feelings about it. That's the crazy part.

I just feel incredibly blessed to be in a job that isn't that demanding. Whether that's because of my own intelligence, my ability to prioritize, or just the nature of the role itself, I'm able to handle what I need to in just a couple of hours a day. No meetings. Virtually no meetings. That alone is pretty awesome. There's so much freedom in that. I don't take that lightly.

At the same time, I'm definitely tired. I need to be more cognizant of the fact that when I get in a good workout—like a real workout—it takes something out of me. Physically, obviously, but mentally too. There's a cognitive cost. I feel sharper in some ways afterward, but there's also a dip in overall energy. I just don't have quite as much fuel left in the tank for other things. And that's okay. I need to accept that tradeoff instead of being surprised by it.

Because the workout is non-negotiable. It's foundational. It sets the tone for everything else—my mood, my confidence, my discipline. So even if it means I don't have as much juice later in the day, that's a trade I'm willing to make. I just need to plan around it better instead of pretending I'll have unlimited energy.

Still in a bit of a limbo state with Dugout Edge. That's been sitting in the back of my mind. There are small things I know I can work on. I know the marketing video is important. I know the content is important. I know that distribution is probably more important than adding another tiny feature right now. And yet… I just can't get myself motivated to work on it.

It's interesting. I can always get motivated when I'm building something. When I'm coding. When I'm solving a technical problem. That feels like play to me. It's engaging. It's creative. It feels productive in a tangible way. I can see the output immediately. But when it comes to making videos, writing articles, creating marketing content—that stuff just feels… boring. Or at least less stimulating.

Even though, rationally, I know it might be the highest leverage thing.

That's the tension. I end up procrastinating on the hard, less exciting tasks by doing the easier, more fun ones. Coding. Analysis. Tweaking little optimizations. Things that feel productive but maybe aren't moving the needle in the biggest way.

And the pattern is predictable. When I leave those tasks for the end of the day, when my energy is lower, there's no chance I'm going to choose them. Of course I'm not. I'm going to default to what feels good and easy. So maybe the answer is obvious: do the hard things first. The things I don't want to do. The things I'm not internally motivated to do.

There's something to that idea of eating the frog first thing in the morning. Especially for me. Because once I get into coding mode, I can get lost in it for hours. It's like a comfortable cave. But marketing requires a different kind of energy. A different kind of vulnerability, maybe. It's outward-facing. It's judgment-prone. It forces me to think about positioning and storytelling and what other people think.

Coding is safe. Marketing is exposure.

That might be the real root of it.

I say I'm bored by writing articles or making videos, but maybe I'm just uncomfortable with the idea of putting something out there that can be judged. When I ship a feature, it's functional. It works or it doesn't. When I ship a video, it's me. My thoughts. My framing. My taste.

That's a different kind of risk.

So maybe this limbo with Dugout Edge isn't about not knowing what to do. It's about not wanting to step into that next phase. Building is comfortable. Promoting is uncomfortable. But promoting is necessary.

Overall, though, I feel good. Productive. Blessed. Tired, but in a satisfying way. Rode my bike. Took a nap in the park. Got my work done. That's a pretty great Monday by most standards.

I just need to be more intentional about energy management and more disciplined about tackling the tasks I avoid. Do the uncomfortable thing first. Protect the workout. Accept the tradeoffs. And keep moving forward, even if it's just small steps with Dugout Edge.

Small steps are still steps.
