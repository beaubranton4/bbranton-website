Beautiful Saturday out. I feel like I say that every Saturday, but it really has been a beautiful year in San Francisco. Biked all the way to Stonestown Mall today—six and a half miles each way. Solid little ride. Never done that route before. Stopped by a local Hawaiian food chain I hadn't heard of before—looked great.

Thoughts today on virtue signaling. Everybody needs a place to virtue signal, a place to flex, to feel special, to feel desired. The gym, the mall, Instagram, TikTok, pickleball—people just love having a place to flaunt what they've got. I think it's a useful framework to keep in mind when building anything, whether digital or physical.

For example, walking around the mall today, I noticed moms looking a little hotter than they probably need to be, walking dogs or with kids. Not everyone fits this mold, but it reminded me—when I was a kid, I'd go to the mall to check out people, to flirt. The gym's similar: you get a little pump on, feel stronger, and maybe get people to check you out. That's why Lululemons are so popular—they make your butt look good. No other reason.

It's a great lens for thinking about business. Gyms aren't just about working out—they're about being social, about being part of a collective, about showing up and being seen. Even if you're not actively talking to anyone, your presence is a signal.

If I were to build an app for baseball, I'd need to take that into account. How can I create a platform that incentivizes showing off what you care about? "Dang, dude, you got a really nice swing." "Your stats are awesome." That kind of recognition is powerful.

Just some quick thoughts today. Time for lunch.
