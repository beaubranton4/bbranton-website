Got back from Switzerland yesterday around 3–4pm. I was absolutely gassed from the flight and from being sick in general. Even though I slept a solid 6–7 hours, I still feel exhausted. I went down around 8pm and woke up at about 5am, which at least puts me on a decent schedule to get back into the rhythm after jet lag. But the tiredness is still there — probably just the tail end of being sick.

Keeping this one short today. I'm looking forward to getting back into my routine, even though the holidays always disrupt things. And honestly, I'm dreading going back to work, even though I barely have to work. I can't even imagine how I'd feel if I had to actually go into an office or had a more stressful job.

One bright spot: I did wake up and put in about an hour and a half on Dugout Edge, working on the practice planner. I really want to reset — to just start over and live my days in a way I'd actually be proud of. No bad habits. With discipline. With intention. And with clarity.
