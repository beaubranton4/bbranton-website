I've been reflecting on my reflections lately—the daily journals I've been writing—and it's interesting how my mind always leans toward improvement. Every entry seems to circle back to what I need to do, how I can be better, the actions I should be taking. I'm always forward-thinking, always proactive, which is a strength, but it also means I'm rarely just living in the present.

Some of my entries are more reflective, which feels good, and maybe I need a little more of that. Still, I can't help but notice that my brain immediately jumps to the next step: what's next, what I need to work on, what I can improve. That tendency definitely comes from my dad. I think if most people started journaling, they'd probably focus on what happened that day or what was on their mind in the moment. Technically, that's what I'm doing too—but for me, my thoughts are always one step ahead, hardly ever planted in the now.

I've also been thinking about motivation and how it comes in waves. I know I'm motivated to start my own business and build something, like Dugout Edge, but the energy isn't constant. When I wake up, I'm eager to dive in. Then I work out, get a little tired, and the motivation dips. It fluctuates throughout the day. The question is: how can I maximize that? How do I account for the fact that motivation isn't a 24/7 resource?

In the background, there's always this nagging voice telling me I don't have that much time. That I need to start, I need to go, I need to move faster. And I know there's truth in that. But I also worry—what if I put years into this, only to find out it won't pay off? What if it's a waste of time? Right now, I've made about $400 but spent about the same on AI tools and website costs, so I'm sitting at net zero. That's not the end of the world—it's early, and the goal is growth—but I can't help but wonder about the cost.

Am I wasting my best years? Should I be outside more, doing things I deeply enjoy instead of grinding on this? The strange thing is, I do enjoy building and creating. But maybe it's a secondary joy, something I tell myself I have to do. Almost like homework. I've always been good at homework, and once I sit down to do it, I don't mind it—but given the choice, I'd probably rather be doing something else. Maybe this business work feels similar.

I'm not 100% sure yet.
