Entrepreneurship 808 (Lesson 1)

This will be a series where I continually write about things I'm thinking about related to entrepreneurship. Here is the first one:

A great framework for finding a business idea is to think about what will save people's time and effort. DoorDash, for example—yes, it's food delivered straight to your door. But in reality, what people are buying is someone else's time and effort. They don't want to take the time and effort to drive to the store and go get their food. At every pay scale, there are people who are lazy, and they are willing to trade time for money. To take it one step further, if you're going to save time, you're going to want to save time for someone who has an extremely high hourly rate (aka rich). I like to think in hourly rate because it allows you to standardize around how much time you're saving. How much time does your project save? What is the hourly rate of your average customer? Then price accordingly.

If you can find someone whose hourly rate is $1,000—people like Jensen Huang, Tim Cook, Jeff Bezos—I'm almost positive these people would pay $1,000 just to save time on something they'd rather not do. A lot of the stuff they already do is outsourced anyway.

What I mean by that is there are people in Pac Heights who are CEOs or maybe they're running a bunch of companies or a bunch of real estate. Their hourly rate may be thousands of dollars per hour. Instead of spending an hour doing the dishes, they hire someone for $200. They focus on running their business and generate another million dollars this year. So their hourly rate, whatever you divide that into, equates to something like a thousand dollars an hour.

Whereas if you target someone who is working at McDonald's, they literally have a minimum wage hourly rate. Helping them gain back time is, unfortunately, not as valuable as helping someone whose hourly rate is way more. Honestly, I think I'm just saying that you want to build a product for rich people, especially if it's going to be a product that saves them time.
