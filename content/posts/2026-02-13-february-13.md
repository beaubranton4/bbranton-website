Yesterday I missed my journal entry again, but it was a good day. Had bursts upon bursts of energy, and I look forward to keeping that. I think that in this short time window where AI adoption is limited, the window is limited—these short bursts of energy sustained over a long, consistent period of time are going to be key and vital to success. Especially when I'm going to be competing with other bots, other people who are much smarter than me, who know how to use these tools, who are building tools that are building tools that are running teams of agents. I'd like to get there, but I just don't quite trust these things yet. I don't have the resources just yet, but maybe I should think about investing. I maybe just need a little bit more time to think about it. And then maybe I can run something like OpenClaw for some of these projects. I'm just not sure if it's worth the investment, but maybe it 100% is.

In either case, I made tons of progress yesterday with Dugout Edge. It started out as a bit of grasping at straws on what do I do, but it ended up being a super productive day. Rebuilt the entire premium layout and workflow for premium users. I published my branch with all of the changes regarding linking practice plans to templates and linking drills to practice plan previews. I built out and redid the UI for a lot of the different pages—the coaching handbook and the Dugout dictionary. Oh, and then not to mention I published an entire array of articles: one pillar article on the top equipment that a coach needs to buy in 2026, and 15 other articles for each of those items that we recommend. So if I recommend that a coach buys a fungo, I have another article on top 10 fungos. Used Open Claw to populate all 150 images. None of them have affiliate URLs right now, but all I need to do is go into Amazon and do that. Apparently there's an API that I can use as a creator, but I need to have had at least 10 sales in the last month, which unfortunately I have not done. So my affiliate status has been weak, Dugout Edge is a little bit weak—I need to boost my game for affiliate marketing, then I can automate a lot of that stuff.

And then in another random bout of energy, I created a website called D1 Picks, completely stood it up from nothing. I'm hoping that I can run a few TikToks, get a little bit of traffic, just kind of test out the idea. I think that college sports is kind of an underserved niche and college baseball in particular. There's a ton of upsets, which means to me that there's a ton of alpha in those bets. So yeah, I'm just gonna kind of string that one along. Obviously Dugout Edge will be my priority. Again, I'm kind of going back—should I split my time? Maybe I just want to 100% dedicate myself to Dugout Edge. But this could be an interesting little fun side project, a little bit more analytical. Maybe that's something that I could put on my resume as an analyst. We'll see.

In any case, lots to do. By the way, Opus 4.6 is amazing but also trash—it eats your tokens at like a 10x rate. You can throttle it low, medium, high. I was on high and it ran out of tokens in like 20 minutes. So I'm just using Opus 4.5 because I found that it's amazing and I don't think I need to bump anything up. Maybe if I have a really hard task, I can try Opus 4.6. But we'll see.

Anyways, Valentine's Day weekend. I'm not going to make a lot of progress, but looking forward to college baseball season. And just continuing these kind of good vibes. Having a focus is nice. Having a focus is good. Building, learning how to use AI to create things digitally. But I don't know, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Maybe when everyone's zigging, I should be zagging. I should be building in the physical world. But who knows.

Also talked to the founder of the Bay Area Men's Baseball League. Sounds like I could get a team together. They're looking for a team, but they need 10 guys. And I've got Aaron who can commit, but I'm not sure if we've got anyone else. We also don't have any pitchers. Just kind of an issue, kind of a problem. I wish Zach was still living with us. I'll hit up some of the Stanford baseball guys. Still no pitchers. Anyways, we'll see. I want to get involved in baseball again somehow—either playing baseball, playing wiffle ball, or coaching. But maybe this is not the time. Maybe I have to focus on heads-down building. Too many things. I need to focus still.

What I'm starting to realize is that there's no single formula for success, but there are common basics that all successful people must follow. And that is: picking a domain that you're interested in, sticking with that domain for an extended period of time, and combining hard work, discipline, and passion toward that goal or discipline. That's really all it is. If you can do that, you can win.
