Fun early night playiing pool and bulgarian (the card game) with friends. There's not much better than laughing and playing with people you enjoy being around.

Finally had an ideal morning. Woke up at 8:30am on a Saturday. Did some pushups and some stretching. Meditated for 10 minutes and now getting my journal entry in. I'll wrap this up and take 5 minutes to plan my day and then I'll get started.

## Things I need to do:

I need to learn how to optimize Claude Code usage. Now that I'm paying for Max, i haven't hit the limit once yet so i know I'm not utilizing it how I should. I'm thinking tests, agents and usign the Claude app more can be helpful. Boris, the founder of Claude Code had a really good post for me to reference: https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177 

Getting close to publishing the practice planner on Dugout Edge. Working through building out the various practice plans. Hoping to release a public version by tomorrow and a premium version by the end of the next week. The biggest thing is going to be making sure that the premium data saves in local storage with the team. People can save their drills, favorite drills and their plan. Then also making sure changes don't effect premium/public functionality. I should release with as simple a version as possible and get feedback to iterate. Price will stay same for now? Or maybe increase from 4.99 to 6.95 a month? A/B test conversion rates? then i have to implement tracking. Gosh, i can't believe people did this without coding agents. Masochists.

I also probably should start building out my own library of Dugout Edge branded content and drills. Maybe i can outsoure that.

Checked earnings from my side projects last month. Spend My Stipend is down 50% YoY, a continuous downtrend. All in all, pretty happy about something i made 4 years ago and didn't really touch after that. I should definitely spend a few days this year and revamp it. Add a database of products and keep the prices up to date. Build a calculator. Migrate off of wordpress.

I still think building a wordpress editor enabled by coding agents would be an amazing business. But let's stay focused until we decide to give up on Dugout Edge.
