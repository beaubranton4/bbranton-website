Today's thoughts are all about leverage (inspired by Naval) — how it's changing, how I'm applying it, and how I need to get better at it.

First, creating digital products and software isn't as high-leverage as it used to be. It's just too easy now. Anything online — websites, PDFs, courses — can be analyzed and replicated by AI at scale. What used to take a team hundreds of hours can now be reverse-engineered in a few hours with the right tools.

Take my own experience. I essentially recreated the USA Baseball website — probably a 100-hour project for them — in 5–10 hours. I didn't copy it word-for-word, but I used it as inspiration, translated it into my own words, and polished it. The real differentiator is curation: knowing what content matters, how to present it, and what details actually serve the user.

That discerning eye — the human advantage — is shrinking. AI's sense of taste and context is already about 80% there. When I ask it to write about baseball, it almost looks right, but not quite for someone who actually knows the sport. Yet it's getting closer every day. There's really nothing stopping someone from cloning a site and having AI generate something almost identical in a few hours. The last 20% — human judgment and taste — is still my edge, but it's narrowing.

That leads to the second part of my reflection: applying leverage in everything I do. Right now, too much of my work is a direct exchange of time for output. I want every hour I put in to produce 10x, 30x, or even 100x the return, not just 2x or 3x. That's true leverage.

This applies to business too. With Dugout Edge, I'm putting in hours, but the upside isn't necessarily 100x in capital or profit. I could grow organically, slowly, with margins near 99%, and eventually hit $100K ARR — but maybe it takes five years. Alternatively, if I invest money — in ads, contractors, partnerships, design — I could accelerate the curve. I could reach $100K ARR faster, overshoot it, and by year five, potentially hit $1M ARR, spending $500K a year but profiting $500K. The difference is capital as leverage, and I need to embrace it.

Leverage comes from three sources: labor, capital, and technology. I'm already leveraging technology and my own labor, but to grow beyond my personal bandwidth, I need to use capital leverage more strategically. That means hiring, outsourcing, marketing spend — all ways to ensure my time isn't trapped doing low-leverage tasks like designing in Canva or fixing small details. The goal is to focus only on high-leverage inputs that multiply output exponentially.

Naval sums it up in The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: Find a Position of Leverage.

On a more philosophical note, Naval also said:

"If it entertains you now but will bore you someday, it's a distraction. Keep looking."

It's a reminder that true leverage comes from working on things that compound, not things that feel exciting in the moment. Distractions masquerading as progress don't sustain meaning. The challenge is to keep looking until the thing that still excites you years from now is the thing you're building today.

Finally, there's this: learn to do things for their own sake, not for any other reason. That's the quiet antidote to all the optimization and leverage thinking. If the process itself doesn't hold meaning, even the most leveraged work becomes hollow. There's something pure about doing things simply because they resonate with you, because they feel right — not because they bring money or recognition. Sometimes the highest leverage is joy itself: doing the work that energizes instead of drains.

Maybe the balance I need is this: chase compounding returns in life and business, but stay rooted in doing things for their own sake — because they matter to me, right now.
