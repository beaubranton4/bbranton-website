Wow. That's insane to even say out loud. It genuinely feels like it was just New Year's, and somehow we're already here.

Lately, I've been feeling this creeping sense that the end is getting closer for knowledge workers. I don't know if it's the echo chambers of Twitter, living in San Francisco, or just pattern recognition kicking in, but it feels hard to ignore. What's strange is that I don't think this is new for me—I think I've been early to this thought for years. I remember telling Abby five or even ten years ago that recruiter roles wouldn't exist in the same way. I'm still fairly confident in that prediction.

I don't necessarily think this means fewer jobs overall, or no jobs. But I do think it means fewer jobs for people in tech with the kinds of skills we've spent years developing. The technical skill set itself just doesn't feel as important as it once was. Knowing how to work a computer, analyze data, write SQL—those things alone don't feel like durable advantages anymore.

That said, I do think being a data analyst taught me something far more valuable than the tools. I learned how to ask the right questions. I learned what data actually matters, which KPIs move the needle, how to motivate operations and structure decisions around numbers. I learned how to simplify—to strip things down to the bare minimum. After years of living inside dashboards and reports, you realize there are only a handful of metrics that actually empower people and drive behavior. Too much data is often worse than too little.

Those are intangible skills. They're hard-earned and hard to replicate, and they still give you an edge over someone who's never worked with data before. In that sense, I'm genuinely grateful for my time in this field. It's shaping how I think and how I build, especially as I work on Dugout Edge.

But I can't help feeling a little uneasy.

Dugout Edge is growing, which is amazing. Realistically, maybe I'll make $2,000 to $5,000 from it this year—best case. That's not nothing. But when I zoom out and think about how much time I've poured into it, it gives me pause. I really started working on it seriously in August. I spun it up back in April—almost a year ago now—but at that point it was just a landing page, some copy, and the first iteration of the lineup generator. That alone took about a month. I didn't even make it a paid product until September.

And I keep coming back to this thought: there's going to be a day—not far off—when building something like Dugout Edge takes days or weeks, not months or years. One of the traditional moats has always been time. Grinding for a year is often a moat in itself. You can compress time with capital or leverage, but now the technology leverage is so powerful that those timelines are going to collapse—100x, maybe 1,000x faster.

That's what worries me.

I worry that I'm applying a huge amount of leverage—more than most people around me—to something that doesn't need that leverage. Relative to the rest of the world, I am highly leveraged, even if it doesn't feel like it when I scroll Twitter and see people doing insane things with AI agents and bots. It feels like I'm digging my shovel into a pit of nickels instead of a pile of gold. The nickels are real, and finding them is better than nothing. But should I keep digging there? Or should I spend my time searching for gold and then apply my leverage there?

That's the real question I'm wrestling with today.

Despite all of this, I still feel incredibly grateful. I have a job that gives me time and flexibility. I'm fully remote, which so many people no longer are. Honestly, it's one of the best jobs in the world in terms of lifestyle. I just don't know if it leads anywhere. There's no prestige, no clear career ladder, no obvious advancement. But it is teaching me how to think like an entrepreneur—and I suspect that's what everyone will need to become anyway.

At the same time, I struggle with the idea of the solopreneur long-term. I don't think a solopreneur beats a company head-to-head. The company is always going to win at scale. And yet, paradoxically, this also feels like the best time in the world to be a solopreneur. The tools are leveling the playing field in ways that have never existed before.

So I'm left with this uncomfortable, honest question:

Am I being lazy?
Or am I just being myself?
