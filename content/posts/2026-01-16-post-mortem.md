Forgot yesterday, so doing this post-mortem.

So busy trying to get the premium version of practice planner out of the way I missed this entry.

Signups are still low and I'm getting worried. Why was I getting an average of 1 signup per day in September?

In either case, I think I should start hiding these entries. Not much upside in publishing them, right?

Story of the day was Sony Open with dad and Waikiki with the parents. Teasing dad.

Realization that I can be very critical of others and also that I've gotten really good at changing habits. I'm not perfect but i've added a bunch of good habits last year and dropped a few of the key bad ones. I've built that muscle.
