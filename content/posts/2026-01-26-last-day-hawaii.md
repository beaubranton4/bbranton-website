Last day at home (in Hawaii). Feels like a good start to 2026. Reset, refresh, spend time with family.

The story of the day was sunset dinner with parents at Kaimana. Rainbow's garlic fried chicken was actually pretty good with the chili all over. Really just thankful for all of this time spent with my parents (and with Abby for a week), getting to know them better through the eyes of an adult—or whatever you want to call my 30-year-old self.

I accomplished everything that I wanted to when I was here in Hawaii. Ran eight times, went to the gym at least five or six times. Went on two hikes. Surfed twice, golfed five times. Saw my old high school friends. And the big bonus: catching the eruption on the Big Island. An eighth wonder of the world for sure.

Looking forward to going back and getting back into my routine. Going full throttle on decoupling my life from a 9-5 job, working for another company, and building in a new world. Going down the road of solopreneurship. I look forward to assessing whether or not I continue with Dugout Edge or building out something new.

I think mentally, Hawaii was a great break for me. Habit-wise, got out of the rhythm of a lot of bad habits and replaced them with good ones. The only thing I was unhappy with or unsatisfied with was my dietary choices. But it's Hawaii, and the food is way too damn good.
