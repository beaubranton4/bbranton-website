excerpt: 'Thoughts on consistency, content creation, and finding what I enjoy doing every day.'

Second day of journaling, and this feels like a continuation of yesterday's entry—thinking about quitting my job and what comes next. I've been running through a plan in my head, and honestly, I have no doubt that if I spent just one hour a day in each of the following areas—working out, building, marketing, and learning—that by the end of 20 years I'd succeed in becoming an entrepreneur or solopreneur. The math feels simple, but the consistency would be the challenge.

I realized I left something out yesterday: I'd also dedicate one hour a day to creating content—posting about those four hours, what I did, what I learned, what I built. That piece feels really important. Building in public not only keeps me accountable but also grows an audience and creates a natural marketing channel for anything I eventually launch.

The thing I'm wrestling with is whether building in public every single day would actually serve me—or exhaust me. On one hand, I think posting daily would be a fun challenge, and it would teach me how to embrace imperfection. That feels like an important lesson, because I know I have a tendency toward perfectionism. I want to do everything "right" and polished, but that mindset often slows me down instead of moving me forward. Posting every day could help me let go of that and focus on progress over perfection.

On the other hand, I wonder if building in public would attract the wrong audience. People who follow along with my journey would likely be other builders. That's not necessarily a bad thing—if my product ends up being geared toward builders, then it makes sense. But if I'm building something for a completely different audience, like coaches or players in the baseball world, then wouldn't it make more sense to build content that speaks directly to them? That's the strategic tension I need to work through: do I build an audience of peers, or an audience of potential customers?

Either way, the heart of it is that I want to find something I truly enjoy doing every day. If I can figure that out and share it consistently, then the rest of the pieces—audience, business, growth—will fall into place over time.
