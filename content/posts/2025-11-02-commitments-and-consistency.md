Yesterday's Game 7 was incredible — extra innings, Miller on the mound, and the Dodgers pulled it off. Unfortunately, that means they won it all, but honestly, I'm just glad it was such an amazing World Series. Still, I was a little bummed not to watch it with my friends. It's tough when most of them just don't care about baseball the way I do. But what can you do?

I am proud of myself for sticking with my commitment to have dinner with Abby's family instead of skipping it for the game. I think what really got to me was just how good the game turned out to be — that made it sting a little more. It probably shouldn't have bothered me as much as it did, but I can't fake my emotions. I felt how I felt, and that's okay.

This morning I went for a run — hips felt a little off, so I stopped at two miles. Still, it felt good to move again, and I'm happy that my body's getting back to normal. Planning to get a quick workout in now and really hoping this week I can build some consistency again.

Camping is coming up soon, and I'm genuinely excited for that. It's a beautiful day out — one of those crisp fall mornings that just make you want to do something productive. My goal today is simple: get things done without wasting time.

We've got an extra hour today — might as well make it count.
