Yesterday's Game 7 was incredible — extra innings, Miller on the mound, and the Dodgers pulled it off. Unfortunately, that means they won it all, but honestly, I'm just glad it was such an amazing World Series. Still, I was a little bummed not to watch it with my friends. It's tough when most of them just don't care about baseball the way I do. But what can you do?

I am proud of myself for sticking with my commitment to have dinner with Abby's family instead of skipping it for the game. I think what really got to me was just how good the game turned out to be — that made it sting a little more. It probably shouldn't have bothered me as much as it did, but I can't fake my emotions. I felt how I felt, and that's okay.

This morning I went for a run — hips felt a little off, so I stopped at two miles. Still, it felt good to move again, and I'm happy that my body's getting back to normal. Planning to get a quick workout in now and really hoping this week I can build some consistency again.

Camping is coming up soon, and I'm genuinely excited for that. It's a beautiful day out — one of those crisp fall mornings that just make you want to do something productive. My goal today is simple: get things done without wasting time.

We've got an extra hour today — might as well make it count.

anyways - i'm I'm going to Switzerland at the end of this month with my family.  I used chatGPT to help me plan this and I asked it what the weather is going to be like in November because it needs context about what time so it can tell me what sort of weather I'm going to be facing. I asked it.

"Help me plan for my trip to Switzerland. What are some things that I need to bring? I'm going to be going on the day after Thanksgiving, so end of April, first week of December 2025. Please tell me what I need to know, what I need to pack. We're going to be going to Zurich, um, Interlochen, Grindelwald, Lucerne"
