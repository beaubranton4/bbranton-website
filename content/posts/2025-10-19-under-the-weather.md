Feeling a little under the weather today — sore throat, low energy, just generally sick. Two straight days of drinking definitely didn't help. I ended up sleeping most of the day, which I guess my body needed. I didn't have much motivation to do anything, but I still managed to get a few small things done. Every bit counts, even if it's not the most productive day. I'd love to make weekends more productive, but sometimes you just have to accept it and let yourself rest.

Something I've been noticing about myself lately: I love analyzing things — almost too much. I'll sit down to work on Dugout Edge knowing exactly what needs to be done, and somehow I end up poking around the site instead, clicking through pages, looking for other little things to fix. It's productive in a way, but it's also a form of procrastination. It's a disguised kind of laziness.

For example, today I started updating the Practice Planner page to better capture emails — I added a way to get notified when people show interest before launch. That's a good thing, technically, but it wasn't on my to-do list. It's progress, but not the kind I planned to make. I'm starting to realize that I need a much clearer system — a more focused plan for what actually matters in a given work session.

I also noticed that the homepage is kind of a mess right now. There are five different links, one of which goes to a Practice Plans page that's not even finished. It's been live for a couple of days, so I need to clean that up soon.

Truthfully, I've been procrastinating because I don't find building out these individual Practice Plans all that fun. It feels like busywork. I don't love creating content just for the sake of having something to show — it feels necessary, but not meaningful. What I want to do is dive into building the actual Practice Planner. That's where I'd feel excited again.

Still no new signups lately, and I had a failed payment recently. I realized I haven't merged the branch that fixes that issue, so I'll need to handle it manually for now. Not ideal, but it's not happening often enough yet to be a real problem.

Being sick is a good reminder of how fragile everything else feels when your health isn't right. You can't build, plan, or think clearly when your body's off. It's a grounding reminder to take care of myself — because that's the foundation for everything else.

Yesterday I went down to Stanford, and it was just great seeing all the old guys. I think I might've already talked about it a little bit, but it was worth mentioning again. I didn't see a ton of people since I got there late because of the protests, but I still got to catch up with Andrew Somerville, Jack Klein, Alberto Rios, Drew Dowd, and a few of the younger guys. It was fun giving them advice, hyping them up, congratulating them on their seasons — even if some of them were two or three years ago. I also saw Alex Williams and a few others.

It was one of those nostalgic kind of days — talking about old times, funny stories from the nine, senior year memories, all of it. I really need to start a running document of all the stories that come up, because every time we hang out, someone brings up something I totally forgot happened.

Coach Eager and the boys reminded me of one that I'd completely blanked on. It was at Washington, final regular-season series. We were playing for the Pac-12 title — win, and we win it; lose, and Oregon State takes it. We were already locked into playoffs, but winning the conference meant a top national seed. So, big game. We're up 6–5 in the bottom of the ninth, two outs, guy on second after a double. We meet on the mound — Jack Little's pitching (now with the Dodgers, made it to the bigs this year). Apparently, I go up to him and say, "Hey, this guy coming up, KJ — he played on my summer team. He sucks. Go right after him." Jack said, "Fuck yeah," and threw three straight fastballs down the middle. Struck him out. Game over. Pac-12 champs.

Another classic one that always gets brought up — the day I completely missed practice. I think it was a weekend, and I must've overslept. Showed up to the field an hour late, and Tommy Nicholson just told me to leave, said it was unacceptable. So I did — went back, found some guys playing beer die, joined in, got drunk, and texted the team a picture like, "Where you guys at?" They loved it.

I love moments like that — the mix of competitiveness, humor, and camaraderie that only comes from that team environment. Days like yesterday remind me why those years were so special and how much I still carry from them.

Even if I'm sick and dragging today, that little dose of nostalgia and connection was worth it.
