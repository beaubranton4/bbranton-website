Additional thoughts on the paradox of choice.

In a world of endless possibilities, it's easy to feel lost—like you're floundering without any real direction. When everything is available, nothing feels anchored. But in a world with limited possibilities, there's something comforting about it. Those constraints can make you feel like you're actually progressing toward something concrete.

Take a preprogrammed game like Pokémon, for example. Sure, you get to choose which Pokémon you catch, what you do on any given day, which side quests you want to take on—but you still know the exact milestones you need to hit to "beat" the game. The guardrails are there. The path exists. You make choices, but within a known structure.

Life unfortunately isn't like that. But a lot of people crave that structure. They need someone telling them what to do—not in a bad way, but in a supportive, directional way. Some people thrive when the world gives them guardrails, not a prescription.

Others thrive with a blank canvas and unlimited possibility.

My task is figuring out which one I resonate with more, and planning my life accordingly.

Another exercise I should actually sit down and think through: if I had $50M in the bank, what would I do on a daily basis?
