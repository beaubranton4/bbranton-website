Just got back from camping today in Bodega Bay. Those are truly the best experiences. The most worthwhile endeavors: trips with friends, adventures in new places, hanging out, talking, playing games, chatting, bantering. Now, there is often a lot of drinking, which may or may not be necessary. It sure is fun though.

This one was really nice because the drive wasn't that far. The weather was wonderful. The fire was hot. The food was great. We made brats, had the standard breakfast in the morning, taco bowls for lunch, and then Thomas' KBBQ for dinner. It makes me think that, even though I really want to become rich and wealthy, these memories are what will ultimately make me rich and wealthy. These experiences. I don't think a lot of people have these sorts of experiences. I consider myself in the top 0.01% in that regard.

I wrote down one quote today that really rang a bell and struck a chord: decision fatigue kills consistency. I think I started getting at this point earlier this week—that I need to simplify, simplify, simplify. If I can just say my focus is these three things, then I can ruthlessly prioritize. It makes everything else easy if I'm clear on what I need to work on.

If I have to juggle 200 things at once, I'm not going to be consistent. I'm not going to be productive, and I'm not going to be efficient. Decision fatigue often comes with so many options. But if I make a decision and I pick a handful of things to work on and focus on, that's what will make me successful. I need to think about that as I go throughout life and what I'm doing. Obviously, life is very multifaceted. You have to focus on many different things in order to be a human being. But as I go throughout my day-to-day, I think if I can just focus on three things, it will allow me to be consistent. And we all know, looking at Tommy Edman, consistency is what makes you successful. Steady Eddie. Never too high, never too low—just straight-line consistency.

So as I go throughout this week and do the things I need to do: one, I'm going to get all my physical fitness in—mental fitness, physical fitness, that's category one. Two, Dugout Edge. Plain and simple. Three is planning fun—more adventures like camping trips. One final one for December. Maybe just happy now, or with friends makes it even better. So those are my three priorities for this week.

I also can't stop thinking that this to-do list system that will help me keep track of my life—in terms of what I need to do, my journals, what I'm thinking about, my short-term and long-term goals—I need to build a system. An automated system that will make this work and that I will use because it's really hard to keep track of all these things. On the other hand, I go back and forth about whether maybe I just need to live day by day, minute by minute, moment by moment, as opposed to trying to plan everything out.

But I think it's a constant assess, reassess, assess, reassess kind of thing. Either way, I think that this would be the tool I could build for myself that would save me the most time in my life and help me achieve my goals.
