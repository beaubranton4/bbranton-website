Quick update on Dugout Edge. Yesterday, I finally got a new free trial sign-up — the first one in ten days. I had a drought where no one was subscribing, even though site traffic was steady. Fall Ball is in full swing right now, and I think that's part of it. Coaches aren't in discovery mode; they're already deep into their seasons, focused on games and players rather than new tools. That's fine — every business has its seasons. Maybe this is Dugout Edge's "winter."

But what really caught my attention was that conversion rates dropped sharply between October 5th and October 15th. People were visiting the site, clicking around, but not signing up. Even when they hit the paywall, hardly anyone started a free trial. The only real changes I had made were adding the feature request banner, a "Request a Feature" pill, and some social proof. When I stepped back and looked at it again, I realized it actually came off a little scammy — like, "Wait, you're asking for feedback and I haven't even signed up yet?" So I removed them. And then, literally the next day, I got a free trial. Coincidence? Maybe. But still, it feels like a clue.

I'm expecting things to stay slow for a bit, but that's okay. This is the time to build — to refine, to improve. Especially the practice planner. The more I work on it, the more amazed I am by what's possible with today's tools. I've been experimenting with the Canva MCP, which lets me generate designs through text. I even uploaded a 200-page PDF — Coaching Youth Baseball the Ripken Way — and asked Cloud Code to generate a full SEO page architecture around practice plans, examples, and templates for coaches. It literally did it for me. Now I just have to design the pages.

The plan is to make those pages downloadable — some open and some locked behind a paywall. That could become a great lead magnet for the practice planner.

But stepping back from all of this, I realize what I'm doing here — these journals, the experiments, even the frustrations — are all part of showing my work. I want to build the habit of documenting things, not just for others but for myself. It's like a living history of what I was thinking and building at the time. One day, I want to look back and say, "This was the early stage of Dugout Edge. Look how far it's come."

Still, I know these journals aren't enough. They stay tucked away in ChatGPT, hidden from the world. I need to put more of this out there — in public. I need to create, share, and show my work more visibly: written posts, videos, screenshots, even quick updates. It's hard, though. Between a full-time job and building Dugout Edge, content creation feels like another mountain to climb. I tell myself I don't have the bandwidth, but maybe that's just an excuse.

What I really want is to automate showing my work. Imagine a system that takes what I'm already doing — my commits, my journal entries, my screenshots — and automatically turns them into posts, videos, or updates. Something that clips, captions, and shares my progress in real time. That could actually be a fun side project — a "build in public" automation engine. And I could even document the process of building that as part of showing my work.

At the end of the day, I know I need to be on social media — not just for my business, but for my life. Life equals business to me. I just need to find examples of people who are doing this well — builders who document, storytellers who share their process — and create a swipe file of accounts to emulate. Maybe I don't even have to show my face or talk. I just need to start somewhere.

Because the truth is, the world doesn't reward silent builders anymore. It rewards those who show their work.
