Ever since I tried to get into the habit of doing these journal entries at night, I've failed a lot more often than I would like and the journal entries are shorter than I'd like them to be. So I think I'm going to go back to journaling in the morning.

Skipped yesterday's journal, so I'll start there.

Yesterday I spent a ton of time in front of my computer, which was good and bad. It was a little bit more frustrating than I wanted it to be. I spent a good chunk of the day going through Dad's hard drive to find baseball videos of myself and I did find them, which is great. I ended up realizing that a ton of the 2018 videos were actually on my hard drive and on my laptop, which is great—I have them—but iCloud is just such a pain. It's cumbersome and it's more of a sync mechanism than it is a backup. And it's really annoying that if you sync everything, all of the files exist on all of your devices, which then in turn uses up a ton of memory. So what I'm trying to do is either figure out how to upload everything to iCloud as a backup versus as a sync device, or I'm going to maybe get a separate hard drive or a separate backup system because I don't think that it's smart to only have these photos and videos on my hard drive. At the same time, there are probably some videos and photos I don't want uploaded to iCloud. I will need to figure something out.

In either case, it was a really fun journey going down memory lane. I went and saved all the YouTube videos from my senior year and reminisced on the glory days of playing baseball at Stanford, having a monster senior year. Truly the best year of my life. It's always fun to reflect back on those sorts of things.

Funny enough, I spent all of yesterday reminiscing on my Stanford baseball career. And this morning I found out the news that Coach Marquess—one of the most storied and beloved college baseball coaches of all time—is essentially on life support this morning. I'm not sure exactly when it happened, but Coach Eger called me today and told me the news that basically he is at the end of his life.

I have some mixed feelings. Sad, obviously. Just thinking about all that he had meant to me and my life and my teammates. And how in some ways I resented him because of the swing changes, how he made me take until I got a strike, putting me at a significant disadvantage compared to other hitters who didn't have to do the same thing, just because of my size. And sometimes I do think what could have happened to my career if I didn't play for him. But at the same time, what happened happened, and I'm thankful for every moment of it and for him giving me the opportunity to join such an illustrious program at Stanford. It changed the trajectory of my life. And I will be forever grateful.

What makes it even stranger is that I woke up at 4:00 AM this morning wide awake. I was playing in a competitive pool match. And I was taking too long to shoot and I lost the match because of that. It signified to me that my mind was telling me that I was running out of time. I immediately started thinking of different baseball-related ideas—texting my coaches to ask about videos, where they get them, performance chewing gum for baseball players and athletes. And then of course, the Mark Marquess technique of tracking every single bit of data on players: how they performed in practice, how many errors they make, how many throwing errors they make, tracking hits, home to first timing, everything. Collecting data during practice so that he could make the best decisions as possible during games. How we tracked every single pitch. I think that a lot of teams could learn from this. And I think that there are a lot of tools that I could build to help teams do this.

Lastly, just his coaching style. The types of drills that we did, the attention to detail, the repetition, the amount of positive reinforcement that he gave, the amount of negative reinforcement he gave. He was always yelling during practice because he knew he was watching and you knew when you did good and you knew when you did bad. He was absurd. But at the end of the day, he was a great coach.
