Story of the day:

Looking for my Garmin late at night. Took it off earlier in the day at the beach and put it in the beach bag. Just watched 7 Dials with family. Using the find watch feature that plays a sound. Thought I was going crazy because the sound was coming from the plant outside.

Turns out it was in the plant outside. Mom had emptied the bag to get the sand out.

Been feeling great. need to remember how i felt during this trip and why.
