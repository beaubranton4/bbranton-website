I had a really good time at the Banya yesterday. $120 for a good 4 hour experience is totally worth it in my opinion. The costs must be insane, but as a revenue generating operation I like the idea.

Woke up to some not so great news. Sounds like Gamechanger is developing a feature to help coaches generate lineups which is unfortunately the number and only feature. 

I can take it as validation or shy away from the competition. In any case, it's sort of lit a fire under my butt. I need to grow and expand this thing while i have the momentum before Gamechanger eats my lunch. I'm the Tom and they're Jerry. I'm quick and they're slow. 

Onwards.
