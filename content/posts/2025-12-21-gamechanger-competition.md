I had a really good time at the Banya yesterday. $120 for a good 4 hour experience is totally worth it in my opinion. The costs must be insane, but as a revenue generating operation I like the idea.

Woke up to some not so great news. Sounds like Gamechanger is developing a feature to help coaches generate lineups which is unfortunately the number and only feature. 

I can take it as validation or shy away from the competition. In any case, it's sort of lit a fire under my butt. I need to grow and expand this thing while i have the momentum before Gamechanger eats my lunch. I'm the Tom and they're Jerry. I'm quick and they're slow. 

Onwards.

5 Ideas:

1) A device that helps you breathe. Like forme but for breathing. Not sure how to make that work biomechanically. But i always forget to breathe when i'm working.
2) Oahu needs a south shore wedding venue that is affordable. Doesn't need ocean views
3) A group that meets weekly and plays different sports for free
4) Past college and outside of work, there is no concept of cohorts. It would be nice to be a part of a cohort or a class of like minded but diverse people striving towards some similar goal that enables social interactions and community
5) A food truck for dogs in the city like we saw in santiago
6) Need a cooking, dishes and laundry robot (majority of wasted time)
