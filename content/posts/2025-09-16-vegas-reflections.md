I skipped six days of journaling because of Vegas. Wednesday was packing, Thursday through Sunday was the trip, and yesterday was pure recovery. Finally back to a steady state. This one’s going to be short since I’ve got things to do, but I want to get back into the rhythm. A little Vegas recap, then a reflection on locking back in.

Thursday: headed to the airport around 2 or 3 p.m., met up with about eight friends on the same flight, which made for a fun pregame atmosphere. Frontier wasn’t too bad—some doubts going in, but it worked out fine. As soon as we landed, we dropped our stuff and went straight to BrewDog, where 16 of us had already gathered. Tower of beer, catching up with Bill, chatting with some pizza guys, making a game plan. Walked the Strip—Bellagio, Caesars Palace, some gambling to get into the swing of things. Started small on the machines, then hit a couple tables. Lost $200 right out of the gate—Vegas calls it “donating to the city.” A few people pushed on to the club, but my 30-year-old body couldn’t hang with a 2:30 a.m. start.

Friday: woke up hungover but ready for the first full day. Got a slow start, then Ubered with Aaron and Thomas to old downtown—Circa, California Hotel. Abby and I had a Hawaiian plate lunch, then rejoined the squad. Got hustled by two flamingo girls who weren’t exactly worth the $20 down the drain. Learned craps from Bill, won a little at blackjack next to Aaron (who picked his table based on boob size), and then of course lost it all back. Hit Beerhaus for food, then back for a nap before Cirque. The show was amazing—different than the typical Cirque acrobatics, more rye humor and crude comedy. I really loved it.

Later that night, Abby and I changed and went to Ellis Island, where I lost more money on roulette—celebrated losing, because we couldn’t even remember which color we’d picked for Alex’s birthday spin. Missed Omnia tables, but made up for it with dank halal food.

Saturday: the big day. Odesza pool party. Way too sauced, but such a fun vibe—dancing and jamming with Luke, Bill, Mike, and Dean. Barely remember getting home, just flashes of buffet and Fontainebleau after. Left before Dom Dolla came on—head pounding, too much addy, couldn’t even really sleep. But still a successful Vegas day. Wrapped it up with In-N-Out before heading to the airport.

It all went by too fast, but I felt that old sense of nostalgia—traveling with friends, running wild for a weekend, having that kind of bender adventure. Still, the hangover hit me hard. Spent the next two days completely washed, basically wasted a week. My body just can’t handle the drinking and late nights like it used to. Fun times, but I’m glad it’s over.

Now the reflection: this trip reminded me why I need to take care of myself, why locking in matters. Adventures like this are great, but they’re exceptions, not the norm. What lasts isn’t the memories of drunken roulette or pool parties—it’s the steady rhythm of building, health, consistency, and focus. That’s what I need to protect.
