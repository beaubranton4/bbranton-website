I still find it incredible that I've got one of the best jobs in the entire world. I get to wake up whenever I want—unless I have a meeting, which is maybe once or twice a week. I work from home, and I get to take advantage of all the perks that come with that: going to the gym across the street, running errands, doing chores around the house. Of course, I'm not neglecting my work or taking advantage of my employer—I take my job seriously—but the freedoms of working remotely far outweigh the benefits of going into an office, at least for me.

That said, I do believe that if you're a young startup trying to grow and become the best possible company, in-person collaboration is important. Brainstorming, feeding off each other's energy, holding each other accountable—that's hard to replicate remotely. But that's not the type of company I work for, and I'm grateful for that. What I get back is my time: no commuting, no meaningless banter, no trying to look busy just to look busy. I'm self-motivated, so I get my work done on my own schedule, which leaves me with plenty of free time to focus on the things I want to do during the day.

Remote work also makes sense from a talent perspective. If people can work from anywhere and get paid well, that's a huge attraction and retention tool. There's really not much to complain about, unless you hate your manager or you're being overworked. In my case, I have neither. I have a good manager, I'm well-compensated for my role, and the work is manageable. Honestly, I don't think I could ask for much better.

The only shadow hanging over it is job security. Lately I've been worrying about my relevance—like maybe my role could become unnecessary at some point. But that's something I'll deal with if and when it happens.

More immediately, I need to start prioritizing my health. My brain feels wired for constant dopamine hits—phone scrolling, drinks, distractions. I don't want to throw the word addiction around lightly, but it does feel like the right word. Overcoming it is hard. I think what I really need is to allow myself to be bored more often. Boredom is when your mind starts wandering, when creativity sparks, when you realize what you actually want to do with your time.

On that note, it's funny—I've been searching for "the next idea" to work on, but maybe it's been sitting in front of me the whole time. Abby has been sending me TikToks for years—funny, creative, brilliant stuff. She's basically been curating a bank of inspiration for me without either of us framing it that way. If I look at it not just as entertainment but as education, it flips a switch in my brain. These are the things that resonate with her—and since I love her, and since her taste overlaps with mine, maybe there's a natural bridge there. I can take that inspiration and build something that connects with the kind of audience I want.

So my thoughts for today really come down to three things:
1. I have one of the best jobs in the world. Truly top 1%.
2. I need to allow myself to be bored—it's where creativity is born.
3. I need to start posting on social media. The inspiration is already right in front of me.
