Another year in the books. Naturally, I'm going to take 10 minutes and reflect on 2025. 

I grew a lot this year in many ways, and made a lot of wonderful memories.

As time goes on, it becomes more difficult to recall what happened over 365 days. I always have to go back to pictures to recall the defining moments and the big shifts. Maybe that means I'm not doing enough, I'm not sure. It seems to me, that the least 3-4 years have all meshed together into one amorphous blob of memory without much seperation. And I think that is because life has really been much of the same, but also so different. I've been living in 3075 California Street for the past 4 years now (purchased in November 2021). 

I've had different roommates, and I suppose that has really changed the day to day interactions, but what i do for work, where i workout, who i hang out with. That has been a constant.

This is not a bad thing by any means. It is a fulfilling, gratifying and extraordinary life to live and I'm not taking that for granted. I do think my mind and my being is itching for a change.

Edit: nvm, i did a lot once i put it all down on paper haha


## Here are things I did in 2025:

We started off the new year right at Neel's house in Napa. Debaucherous fun with the gang staying up until late hours of the night sharing stories and laughing.

Abby and I commited to 12 new things (1 a month) and delivered on that. Will continue in 2026.

Grew out my hair a little bit this year. Still not sure if I like it. There are some days i do, and other days I don't. It definitely looks better with a hat on, but I think there's this like 1 month period where it looks good, otherwise it's too long or too short.

Decided on a wedding venue. Kualoa Ranch on 2/6/27. SIX SEVEN?! Start of lunar new year i think lmao.

This year I think I fell in love with baseball again. From the start of college baseball season until the World Series ended in October, I had baseball on the TV around the clock. It drove me to start Dugout Edge and I'm thankful and happy the game is back in my life. I started/captained a volo softball team and organized a fun wiffle ball tournament. I must do that again this year.

I officiated Jeff and Ash's wedding in May. That was a huge honor and a major milestone for me. I've never enjoyed public speaking, but I put a lot of time into an amazing speech and delivered it well. That was another fun day. 

We also spent way too much money on the house this year. Completely redid the back siding and all the windows as well as got a new oven. $40K oof. 

Big highlights were travelling to Chile and Switzerland. 3 weeks in Santiago had me feeling like a native. Although I spent half the time in that mall connected to our hotel. Switzerland may be the most beautiful country in the world. 



Celebrated my 30th in Vegas. Went to the bombanera and watched Cavani score a goal. Portola with the squad and was there for the birth of my future nephew.

1st Christmas with the Mejias and New Years Eve with the friends.

2025 was also the year that I dove into and fell in love with vibecoding. I probably spent more time talking with LLM's and Coding Agents than I did with anyone else. I watched the power of these models transform before my eyes. I first started with Cursor at the end of 2024, when it was mostly just a chat box that helped you with pieces of code that could edit in-line, but it was mostly copy paste. Now, with Opus-4.5 it's almost 100% prompting with very little oversite. I had so many ideas and this is the year I really felt like I had built something. 

In many ways, my entrepreneurial building/coding adventures started during the pandemic in 2020, when I learned how to code in Python so I could create a day trading stock strategy. Then was followed by Spend My Stipend in 2021, my first wordpress website. 2022 and 2023 were empty in this category. I was having too much fun, enjoying being social again and the world returning to normalcy. 2024 it all picked up again when I decided I wanted to become a Data Engineer, which led me to completing the Data Engineering Zoom Camp where I learned how to use an IDE, github, work with databases, orchestrators, and more python. This really led me to see how powerful AI was, which inspired me to revive my stock trading algorithm. I got it to work, and it was trading daily on a virtual machine, but the strategy was faulty. In the end, that got me into using Cursor and coding agents and ultimately led to Dugout Edge.

Dugout Edge has been far and away the most rewarding thing I've worked on this year. I don't know how far it will take me, but I'm going to continue pushing at it until I can't. 

Now that I've spent 1 year honing the skills of vibe coding. I feel unstoppable and believe that i can build anything. For the past 5 years, I've had so many ideas, but I couldn't build them myself. Now I can. My only limiting constraint is time and how intelligently I can apply myself to an idea.

Some other fun highlights: Tahoe trip with the hawaii squad, Jackie and Brennan's wedding on Oahu, B2B open, 2 camping trips up north of SF. Seaweed foraging, Warriors game, Sharks game, SF Unicorns game! 

Golf took a backseat this year in comparison to other years. I still played and those are still some of the best days, but it's expensive, eats up a whole day, and when you're plateauing in skilll it starts to get old. Hope I can bring that back next year.

I started journaling this year. Nearly 90 straight days. I built my personal website and am documenting everything there.

I tried startup seeds, cha2go and built some foundations for 5-8 other ideas ready to go.

Holy shit, what a year! I take back what i said earlier. 

Here is how I've grown this year:

I've really started to prioritize routine and health. While I still give into the temptations of nights out and things that aren't good for my body, I am slowly and surely becoming more disciplined. I continue to workout and focus on my physical fitness. Now I need to really work on what I consume. Both mentally and physically.

I've built a system for staying on track and reflecting. I've prioritized the things that I need to prioritize. The next year will be focused on executing what I know I need to get done.

I'm gaining confidence in myself as an entrepreneur, as someone who can subsist and make it in the world on my own through my technical skills. I still need to learn how to market, to sell and how to attract attention on social platforms.

I get the most energy thinking about and working on these sorts of things. 

When will i be ready to make the leap?
