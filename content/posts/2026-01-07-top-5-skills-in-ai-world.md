I experienced a lot today. I woke up to the news of user testing, purchasing, and acquiring user interviews, which on one hand signifies that the company is doing good or better. And I think I should feel optimistic about the prospects of this meaning of user testing will grow to become a bigger and better company with a more high quality panel. Just giving us more breath in our product offering, which is high quality feedback and user research.

I spent a lot of time with mom just talking about life, career, my desire for entrepreneurship and what a new world with AI looks like. 

I was reminded of the ailments of old age as I had the exact conversation just four to five hours later at dinner. Her short-term memory is definitely getting a lot worse and it's hard to see. I see changes in my dad too, about him. He does seem to be holding on to his sharpness even as the days go by. It's especially hard because I only see my parents once or twice a year. So with each success, with each time I see them, it seems like the gaps and the deterioration of their mental state and their mental health is declining faster and faster. Albeit, it's just getting started. They're not in anywhere near as bad a shape as someone, say like my grandpa was when he passed, my grandma. They're still twenty, thirty years away from that, but you can start to see it and it's only going to get faster and it sucks and made me sad.

Surfed Waikiki today. Waves were surprisingly not too bad. Caught about four or five pretty solid ones. In about an hour, solid sesh and got back in with enough time to watch the sunset. Reminds me how lucky I am to have a second home in Hawaii.

Got dinner at that new burger joint that opened up last year. I guess it's called Something by Chubby's Guess ordered in I can't remember right now And then of course finished off with cow cow a Family staple a family favorite Every time we're back home. We always have to get it a few times.

Taste, 
Systems Thinking, 
Managing Agents, 
How to Gain Attention Online, 
Cutting Through Noise (Focus)

To me, these are the top 5 skills in the new world of AI.

our human brains are not going to develop any faster because we have better technology. we still will have limited time, focus and memory. Cutting through the noise and developing key techniques for a skill will be of utmost importance when it comes to succeeding in a new world. Success through the lens of wealth and fortune that is. Who is to say that is a life worth living? 

Be Someone Who Can Put Together the Pieces:

there are so many amazing AI tools today and they're also fragmented using cloud code in my terminal, the MCPs, connecting to Gmail, and you kind of have to like set them all up and piece them all together if you want to maximize and utilize the efficiency gains. People don't really want to do this setup, they just want to go to a place and have it all work. How can we build that for them?
