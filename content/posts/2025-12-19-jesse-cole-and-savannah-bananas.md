This morning I listened to what might be my favorite podcast episode of all time. Jesse Cole, the founder of the Savannah Bananas, was interviewed on My First Million, my favorite podcast. I loved it because it was two worlds colliding. My extreme interests in business and entrepreneurship paired with my love for baseball and entertainment and fun.

There's no doubt in my mind that Jesse Cole is one of my living role models. If he wasn't before, he definitely now is. I loved a few things about him. One, how passionate and driven he was by not money, not by external reasons, but just purely creating his own world where the fan is put on a pedestal and the customer wins. He isn't concerned about the money or whether or not it's going to work. He's just obsessed with coming up with new ideas and testing them. Coming up with new ideas and testing them. And that really resonates with me because I think that's one of my superpowers. I'm good at coming up with ideas and testing them.

It's really inspiring to see how he has role models and he knows these role models inside and out like the back of his hand Walt Disney, Taylor Swift, Mr. Beast, all of these people who are born to entertain, he's a student of the game and he religiously studies them and applies them in his own ways in his own business. I hope that I can find a canvas to similarly apply learnings from some of my favorite role models into my own business. That's all I really need and I think that dugout edge can be that canvas just as owning a baseball team is that canvas for Jesse.

He also has some really inspirational pieces of advice when it comes to running a business that I really resonated with.

1. Every day he writes down 10 ideas. I'd like to adopt that and apply that in all of my journal entries going forward starting from today. A couple of sound bites that really resonated with me. Your inputs affect your outputs. So whatever you consume on social media is really going to change how you produce things in life, your outputs. That's why he has obsessed over reading, learning about entrepreneurs, specifically those in the physical entertainment space. Create before you consume. He says on a daily basis he likes to get his morning started similar to how I do. Journaling, writing down what you need to get done, writing down your ideas, creating before you consume. Because once you start consuming that creative muscle just kind of it weakens and you start to be influenced by what your brain is consumed.

2. I've talked about this before in you know earlier in this journal entry but finding that canvas I need to find the canvas that will allow me to be creative, test ideas, play, tweak, try, fail, and try again.

And then he's got his own values that he's created. 11 values for banana ball. Funny enough I learned that the 11 values there's a little bit of a fun tidbit there. The 11th letter of the alphabet is K, K is the blanking the elemental symbol for potassium and you know obviously bananas have a lot of potassium so it's a little funny thing but he has 11 kind of core principles. Some of the ones that I really liked entertain always, play the long game, don't be normal, ideas are everything, be constantly curious, obsess over details, and those are the ones that stuck with me. Another quote that he said was start small, dream big.

## 5 Ideas:

1. To get more customers on dugout edge, I should go around the different dugouts and public facilities where kids play baseball and just post a fake generated dugout edge line up. People will see it, see it was generated by dugoutedge.com. Visit the website, get more.

2. It would be great. I've got this kind of automated system for journaling. I'd like to blend in my, you know, physical handwritten to-do list and my morning process into this as well. That way I just have a full comprehensive view of what I need to get done during the day, my calendar, what I'm prioritizing, my goals, and then also my journaling, my ideas. You know, build this kind of into like a to-do list software for myself that maybe some other people might find useful. And then best of all, it will all be, you know, enabled by AI so that I can use LLMs to basically query anything about myself and my day. I think this could be a super valuable tool for myself and for other people. The one hesitation that I have is that I find writing things down to be very, very helpful, especially when it comes to my highest priorities. So I need to think about how to navigate around that.

3. I should start a TikTok channel just talking about hats, new hats that I buy, new hats that I wear to build that audience if I really want to start a hat brand.

4. Should consider building trash shoots for people, custom jobs, or in some way just automatic process of taking out the trash, cleaning trash cans. It's just kind of something nobody wants to deal with.

5. If going down this path with a tea brand, I need to take into consideration 80% of viewers are Or people interested are female. They're really interested in the health benefits The number one way to grow would be to start a social media channel again just talking about maybe specifically barley tea or Korean teas again see what resonates with people Get market research So if I want to start a tea brand if I want to start a hat brand I need to get on socials, you know Know if answer butts I Need to build the audience another thing that Jesse said was Something like lines like you know if you don't have attention good luck
