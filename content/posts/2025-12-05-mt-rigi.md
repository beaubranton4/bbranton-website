Yesterday was epic. Mt. Rigi is epic. By far the most beautiful place I have witnessed with my own eyes. Above the clouds surrounded by the Swiss Alps, it looks like what you imagine heaven might look like. We took a train to the top and took a casual, snow-filled hike down about half a mile. Then spent the rest of the day at a spa and wellness retreat at [Mineralbad & Spa Rigi Kaltbad](https://www.aqua-spa-resorts.ch/de/mineralbad-spa-rigi-kaltbad).

It was such a cool concept. They give you these plastic wristbands that give you entrance into the facilities, enable you to lock and unlock your locker, and pay for your drinks. In list format, the spa included:

- Large pool with different massage areas. Standing seated. Water jets from metal rods.
- Outside, a view and mix with snow and heat.
- A sauna. Nude btw.
- A crystal bath.
- A relaxation room.
- An herbal steam room.
- A relaxation room.
- With food drinks and massages

Maybe I have never been to a proper spa before, but I can't believe something like this doesn't exist in SF or in Tahoe. It probably does and I'm not aware, but if it doesn't, I should start one. It is the contrast between a warm spa while being able to reach out and touch a 3 foot high snow bank that really takes the cake.

Boated back after the sun came down and got dinner at a Christmas market in Lucerne. It was opening night and there was the Swiss traditional St. Nicholas and Soot man (that's what i'm calling him because i don't want to look it up). But basically there's a guy dressed up in black face, completely painted head to toe in black. Really scary actually. Kind of looks like the Grim Reaper in ways. Well he's walking around with St. Nicholas and a band of kids with giant cowbells around their neck, but parading through the grave. Anyways this guy comes up to me. He grabs me. I grab by the arm because I don't know what the hell are you doing. And he takes some of the paint, the black paint, and smears it on my left cheek. I was in shock until I realized that it was part of the tradition. I seriously got scared for a moment, but then I realized it was just a sign that he was being playful and including me in a part of their tradition. The funny thing is, maybe an hour later when the parade was leaving, he spotted me again and marked my right cheek. A little bit jarring, but definitely memorable.

We came home and played "Oh Hell" the game Kenji taught us the other night. I showed them the power of AI coding agents that created a spreadsheet to keep track of the bids and the tricks and the scores in minutes, and then I won the game.

Reminder: I couldn't find any score keepers online for "Oh Hell" aka "Tricks" so might be a one-day mini project i'll have to embark on. Claude almost one-shotted the spreadsheet. Next, I just have to throw it on the web as an app.

Another thought I've had is that does SEO work across different languages? So if I'm ranking for baseball lineup generator in America, if someone types in baseball lineup generator in different language, will my website rank or not?

**THE ANSWER:** is no, but! you can program your site to be built for multi-language SEO. Something to keep in mind as i build dugout edge or any other website. Auto-translated pages do not help SEO.

From chatgpt:

"Google LOVES properly structured multilingual pages using:

- hreflang tags
- correct language metadata
- separate URLs for each language/subfolder (ex: /es/, /jp/)"

Other than the old Swiss grandmas who kept cutting me in line at the Currywurst stand, today was one of the best days I've had - maybe in my life.

P.S. I should start trying to write these journal entries so that my personality shines through. If you read these, you probably think i'm some uber serious hardo. Those who know me, know the true story.
