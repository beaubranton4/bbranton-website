What I want will inform what I do.
Think in inputs, not outputs.

Scatterbrained.

Am I a fool for not building with AI?

The date is November 14, 2025. I’ve been thinking a lot recently about whether I’m even focusing on the right things. I’ve made it a goal to become an entrepreneur — to learn how to build a business so I don’t have to work a 9–5, so I can control my time, have unlimited upside, and bet on myself. But at the same time, I’ve got things pretty good right now. I’m working in this cushy remote tech job where I barely have to do anything. This week might genuinely be the lowest-effort workweek I’ve ever had: Tuesday off, one meeting Monday, one hour Wednesday, and the rest has just been me waiting for people to get back to me. I’ve barely touched my keyboard or my mouse. If my employer saw it, they’d probably think I was stealing from them — not because I’m choosing not to work, but because no one is giving me anything to do. And I’m not going to volunteer myself for extra work; I’ve been in the corporate world long enough to know that doesn’t get you anywhere in situations like this. So I’m not doing anything wrong — just playing the game.

That idle space made me wonder: should I be focusing way more on AI? I woke up this morning thinking, “Am I stupid for not building using AI or embedding AI into my products?” Technically, I am building using AI, but I’m not building an AI product. I keep thinking that if I’m already putting in the effort to build software, it might be just as hard to build an agent-based product. And maybe it’s no harder to get customers paying $1,000 than it is to get customers paying $5. So am I being foolish for not chasing the wave, or am I being smart by targeting lower competition? If I build in the AI space and target B2B customers, would that even give me the kind of life I want?

That brings me back to something Shawn from My First Million said that stuck with me: think of your idols in terms of their inputs, not their outputs. Do you want to be Warren Buffett because he’s a billionaire, or because he spends each day reading financial statements, evaluating companies, and talking to investors? If you admire the work — the inputs — then you can emulate that and let the outputs follow. But if you only admire the result, you’ll never get there because you won’t enjoy or sustain the work required.

So I need to figure out what inputs I actually enjoy. What are the things I could do for hours without burning out? If I want to start a newsletter or a blog, I should like writing. If I want to build software, I should enjoy building or be willing to hire someone who does. I know I like the process of tinkering with a product and hammering away at something until it works. I also know I don’t naturally enjoy selling or marketing — I shy away from it. Maybe I could get better, but it doesn’t energize me. And if I want to do an event-based business, I need to ask myself whether I actually enjoy organizing things, talking to people, coordinating logistics.

There’s also this question of business wisdom. Everyone says, “Solve your own pain point,” “Do something you’re passionate about,” “Go B2B,” but I wonder if that’s limiting me. Should I even be thinking that way? Or should I just jump on trends and build something that fits the moment — like an AI tool that generates marketing content or an AI agent that plans weddings or runs social media? I keep bouncing around between possibilities. It’s the paradox of choice — too many options, not enough clarity.

The one thing that has become clearer is that I need to figure out what gives me joy. What my mind gets addicted to. In baseball, the reason I loved the sport wasn’t because of the practices or the grind — it was the joy of getting a hit, the joy of winning, the joy of being with teammates. Those moments were the dopamine hits that made everything worth it. I could handle the stress, the work, the failure, because those joyful moments were oxygen.

Joy is the oxygen of doing hard things. Just like the body needs oxygen to survive, we need joy at the end of a difficult effort. Without joy at the end of the tunnel, we burn out. But if the work leads to joy — even small, consistent hits of it — we can endure almost anything. We can sustain it. We can even crave it.

So that’s where I’m at: trying to understand what actually gives me joy and dopamine. Not what should give me joy, not what sounds noble or impressive, but the real signals my mind and body react to. If I can align my work with those inputs, then I’ll naturally be able to sustain it. The outputs will come later.

For now, I’m still searching, still thinking, still trying to align who I am with the work that pulls me forward instead of drains me.
