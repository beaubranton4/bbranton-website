My only thought of the day is that I'm glad I learned to vibe code. The thing about vibe coding is that I think the name of it which was dubbed by andrei carpathy vibe coding Inherently has a negative connotation. I think a lot of people think of vibe coding as like non serious Can't build anything but the truth is you can code vibe coding is coding in the new world And I don't think many people are starting to realize that and I think I'm really early to that trend. I think that There's this whole economy that's going to open up and this whole skill set That's going to be created from vibe coding.

I'm not quite sure i like doing that part of my journal digitally. It's much more therapeutic doing it by hand. Going to keep this one short today. Gotta make it to yoga and knock out all my tasks. Have Four Tet and Skrillex tickets tonight at Pier 80. Goes from 5 to 11. See you there

5 Ideas:

1) I could become a fitness instructor and teach classes and workout all day
2) I could become a vibe coding expert on twitter. Sell and create a tools and spend 100% of my time vibe coding and teaching others and providing value for those who want to learn how to vibe code
3) I want to reinvent the bat grip they gave us at the little league world series
4) It would be realy fun to have an air bnb or property somewhere and rent it out
5) Go on adventures with friends and enjoy it
6) Build a TikTok account where I just test and I show the entire account is building in public testing hooks. The first 10 to 100 videos will be all hooks based on which you get the most views. Then use that hook and iterate and iterate and iterate, posting hundreds of times a day the simplest in a programmatic way. No thought involved. Just a simple idea, record, post. Idea, record, post, tweaking and iterating.

1 Story:

A mindful morning of good intentional movement and breathing calmed me. i could finally sit in the sauna in peach without struggling to breathe or feeling my body wound up with stress

I write this retroactively. Four Tet and Skrillex was a good time fueled by things we don't speak of publicly. I love the squad and dancing and singing. The best moments are when the circle opens up and everyone has their arms around each other and you just see smiles.

Admittedly, i recognize that these sorts of cheap (or rather expensive) thrills of mobbing in a concert doesn't appeal to me like it once did. I'll still go and get after it with friends but I know deep down I'd rather be in the back sitting down or frankly at home in bed sleeping by 10pm.
