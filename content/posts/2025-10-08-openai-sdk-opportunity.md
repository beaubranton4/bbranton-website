Yesterday was Tuesday, and the big win of the day was not giving in to the temptation of buying a can of Zyns. For some reason, that urge was incredibly strong both Monday and Tuesday. I'm proud I didn't cave.

On a more interesting note, there was some big news yesterday about OpenAI's release of the ChatGPT application SDK. I might not be phrasing that perfectly, but essentially, OpenAI is opening up the platform so developers can build integrations and apps directly inside ChatGPT. People are already comparing it to the next "App Store," and it kind of feels like it could be.

The way it works is simple: if someone is chatting inside ChatGPT and your app can fulfill their need better than ChatGPT's default responses, your app can pop up right in the chat for them to select. For example, Zillow has already built one of the first ChatGPT apps. It uses Zillow's backend to show home listings, prices, and other real estate data, all within the chat interface. So if you're talking about moving or looking for a place, ChatGPT could automatically bring up Zillow as an option to handle that request.

It's fascinating to think about where this could go. The idea that developers can create mini experiences right inside the ChatGPT ecosystem feels like a massive shift—almost like the early days of the iPhone App Store. There's definitely potential to make something meaningful (and profitable) here. I'm going to spend some time exploring this today—reading documentation, maybe even playing around with a few examples—to see what's really possible with this SDK.

It feels like the start of something big.
