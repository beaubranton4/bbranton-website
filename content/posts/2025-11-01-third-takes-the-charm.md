Third take's the charm.

Had an incredible Halloween party last night — a Harry Potter–themed murder mystery with an electric outcome. Everyone was all in. The costumes were amazing, the energy was perfect, and the Meta Glasses made it even better. We captured some great POV videos that I'd love to share later — it really felt like stepping into another world for a night.

Woke up not too hungover. The weather's beautiful today — one of those crisp, clear San Francisco mornings that makes you feel alive. I went on a bike ride with the Meta Glasses, which gave me an idea: maybe I should start a channel called SF is Dead, where I just bike or walk around the city and show its underrated beauty — the parks, the fog, the views, the real vibe of living here.

Had some incredible Vietnamese food this morning too. Later, I'll be missing Game 7 — all my friends are watching, but I committed to this dinner with the Mejias. Probably a good thing to skip a few beers anyway. I can always meet up with everyone later tonight.

Got a massage today too — an amazing one. It's crazy how different my body feels when all the knots are worked out. While I was lying there, I kept thinking of business ideas. Those Meta Ray-Ban Glasses sparked something — what if there were smart glasses for baseball players or coaches? Something that collects live data, helps them improve, gives tips, or even acts like a robot training partner that tracks swings and pitches automatically. Just a natural way to collect data and feedback.

I'm also feeling really proud of Dugout Edge right now. It's been doing great — genuinely successful. I checked Mark Liu's MRR ranking site and realized Dugout Edge would actually place in the top 100. That's pretty wild. It's proof that I've built something that solves a real problem. I just need to keep building on it. I have zero doubt I can make at least $50K from it — enough to fully replace my income.

Now I'm thinking about what my third business should be. I've done Startup Seeds and Dugout Edge this year. Maybe next is the hat company — the workout hats I keep talking about. Or maybe something different: lead generation for local businesses like massage studios, or other in-person businesses in Pac Heights or Honolulu. Or something social — a weekly Field Day where people meet up to play games and laugh. Maybe even the adult summer camp idea — like Academy Camp, but reimagined. That still sounds amazing.

Another idea that came to mind today: a data analytics tool — basically a next-gen BI platform powered by AI. Imagine something like Periscope, but simplified and more intuitive. Instead of setting up a whole data warehouse, you'd just connect different data sources like Stripe, MCP, and Supabase directly. Each dashboard tile could respond to natural language queries — "Show me MRR by cohort," "Compare new signups vs churn," "Revenue per coach." The system would automatically generate visuals and charts, use AI to prevent redundancy, and allow easy editing. It would make building and maintaining dashboards as natural as chatting. It's wild that no one has nailed this yet. There's so much opportunity in making analytics feel alive — like talking to your data instead of wrangling it.

Beyond that, I keep realizing how many ways I personally use ChatGPT — and how much potential there still is to turn those use cases into real tools. Most people still don't understand how powerful it is. Even though it's well known now, I'd bet the majority of the world has no idea what it can actually do. That's the gap: ChatGPT isn't marketing itself. I could fill that gap — simply by showcasing what's possible. Build wrappers, make specific tools, show real examples. Half the world just needs to see the "aha" moment once. And I already use it in so many creative ways every day.

So maybe my next step is to write down:

1. What I use ChatGPT for.

2. What I use Claude for.

3. What I use Cursor for.

Those three together form my little network of AI agents — my own personal tech stack. If I can document what problems they solve for me, I can identify patterns and build tools for others. Especially B2B — solving the kinds of real problems I've run into while building Dugout Edge.

I should also research accounts that are doing cool stuff with AI glasses — for inspiration, or maybe just to spark my own take on it. But at the end of the day, the goal is the same: do what excites me, build things I'd personally want to use, and help other builders, operators, and creators make their lives easier.

All these ideas — BI tools, smart glasses, AI wrappers — they all orbit around the same core: turning complicated things into something effortless and natural. That's what makes me light up.
