Tried to write my journal at night. Way too late and out of motivation. But not a bad process if I had remembered. Have much more I can recap. Good stories.

Dad and Yankee memory and realization.

Watched Jay Kelly - bleh.

Didn't publish the practice planner, but will tomorrow (2 days behind). But also ahead in some ways. I think I can finish premium by 1/15.

My First Marathon and running back up that hill. 4 miles today at 9 min pace had me gassed. Oh how much difference a year can make.

Time with parents to uncover my own flaws.

Why is the food in Hawaiʻi so damn good.
