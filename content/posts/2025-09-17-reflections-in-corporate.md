excerpt: 'Im not cut out for the corporate world'

I keep finding myself thinking about my place in the world and how I can best contribute to the economy—how I can make the most of my abilities to earn an income, not just for myself, but for my family. The more time I spend in the corporate world, the more I realize I’m not suited for it.

The skills that help people succeed in corporate life depend on the role, the organization, and whether your skill set aligns with what’s valued there. For me, I think the biggest factors are speaking and communication. I’ve gotten so much better at those over the years—light-years ahead of who I was in high school or even college. But still, I don’t think I’ll ever be in the top 10% of speakers, the ones who can effortlessly command a room and sound intelligent in every phrase they utter. That’s not me.

And beyond that, I just don’t have the desire to play political games. I don’t enjoy the unwritten rules of advancement—the fact that success often comes down to who you know, how well you smooth and mooch, and what company name is stamped on your résumé. I hate how circumstantial it all feels. Just like with college admissions, people put weight on signals that don’t really say much about the individual. It doesn’t sit right with me, but maybe that’s just how humans work.

That’s what makes me feel a bit stuck. Maybe those are simply the skills you need to succeed anywhere—even as an entrepreneur. But entrepreneurship feels different to me. It seems much more results-oriented, much more about the actual work you put in and the outcomes you produce. That aligns more with what I value.

At the same time, I don’t think I’m destined to build some venture-backed, B2B-style company. I’m not confident in my ability to sell face-to-face, to pitch, to close deals. What I am confident in is marketing—understanding algorithms, SEO, content, distribution. I thrive behind the scenes. The question I wrestle with is: should I double down on that and accept it as my lane? Or should I push myself into sales, into the uncomfortable places where I’m weaker, and try to become more well-rounded?

Do I let fear keep me in my comfort zone, refining what I’m already good at? Or do I take the leap, expand myself, and try to compete where I feel less secure? That’s the crossroads I’m standing at right now.
