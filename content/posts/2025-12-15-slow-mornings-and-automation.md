I've had a really nice, relaxing, slow morning, and I'm realizing more and more how important it is to set the tone for the entire day. I keep thinking about how crucial it is to have slower mornings in general - less stimulation, less immediately grabbing my phone, less starting the day already stressed out. Instead of waking up and instantly trying to solve problems, I want my mind to start the day by taking in inputs, processing them, letting them go, and being more intentional about actually feeling what's happening in my mind and in my body.

It sounds so zen, so white-girl-Bali-retreat-yoga-instructor, but honestly, it matters. I need constant reminders about how important posture is for me. Posture feels like the root of almost all of my physical issues—my body pain, my breathing problems, my general discomfort, and even this pent-up nervous energy I carry around. I've been thinking a lot about the vagus nerve and how some of the stress I feel might be tied to that. Posture leads to better breathing, better breathing leads to a calmer nervous system, and that whole chain feels like the key for me to actually feel my best.

Today is packed. There's a lot to do, but luckily work itself doesn't feel too overwhelming. I'm being asked to do something I've essentially already done before, so I'll just recreate it in a new document and move on. Then it's about getting everything else handled.

With the end of the year coming up, I can feel that familiar pull to reassess everything. Is it silly to quit my job and fully focus on becoming an entrepreneur? Part of me really thinks this might be the time. There are so many automations I could build now—automated newsletter creation, Instagram posting, selling things in the background. A lot of this feels more possible than ever with AI.

At the same time, I keep coming back to Dugout Edge. Maybe that should be the platform for all of this. Context switching is something I talk about constantly, and I know it hurts me in the long run. Spreading myself too thin across ideas feels like the wrong move. But building automated systems still feels incredibly valuable, especially now, because once they're set up, they can run.

Automation, automation, automation. That's the theme. The goal is to create something automated—an automated business. If I can find something that runs smoothly, shows signs of traction, and has a clear path to scaling, that's when I double down. That's when I triple down.

For now, I'm just looking forward to having a healthy, focused day and staying intentional with how I move through it.
