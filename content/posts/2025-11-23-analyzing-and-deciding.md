I had a realization today that I really enjoy analyzing things to make a decision. For example, I really enjoy the process of comparison shopping. I like weighing all my options, getting all the prices, and then making the right decision. It's somehow fun for me. I think why I would also find owning a business maybe way less stakes. I don't know.

Another case: went to the zoo today. That was Abby and I's one new thing for the month. It was so fun. Seeing these animals, you kind of just forget are living in the same world that you are. Experiencing life. Experiencing in life. Not through the same brain that you are, but I mean, in as far as life goes, living life just like you are in this exact moment. You're overlapping and that is a miracle in itself. These things are amazing beings and it's really incredible to see how evolution has shaped all of these different beings and creatures and animals. It's a little sad to see some animals, but ultimately it's just like, I don't know, I do think it is good for humankind to see all of these things in real life. But I do really feel for the animals. They're held in captivity. They're the unlucky ones. But at the same time, maybe they enjoy their life. They don't know anything better. It's hard to weigh more, but as a human being just likes learning about things, they're incredible. And they're fun.

Going back to analyzing things and making decisions. The reason I say that is because I've spent the last three or four days thinking about which oven to buy. Our oven broke. Our beautiful Thermador oven is a genuine work of art. Unfortunately, the oven just doesn't work. The quote that I got to fix was $2,100. This feels like a big win. We'll be getting a brand new Bosch oven. That's what I've decided on. Bosch $800. About $3,000 for this thing, which is not easy to swallow, but hopefully this thing lasts 20 years and we just won't have to deal with it. That's my hope. The other options we could probably spend about $1,000 if we wanted to at the very, very, very bare minimum. I'd rather get something that's good, that's beautiful, and will last me as long as this house will last me, hopefully.

Buying houses are expensive. Even though financially it should pay off in the long term (if the house appreciates). I'd say right now we're net even. 525K for down payment. 100K in fixes, repairs, etc etc. All in 625K. Probably
