title: Finding Flow Through Trial and Error

I just had a strong realization. I think I've known this but I've finally been able to put it into words that I strongly enjoy the process of making something work through trial and error.

It's why I enjoy baseball. It's why I enjoy golf. It's why I, as frustrating as it can be sometimes, ultimately love data because there's a number and you can often very much be able to understand what it is.

I think that's why I'm enjoying this process of live coding even though it's extremely slow and probably extremely inefficient. I love prompting away, prompting away until the code works and I get the result that I'm satisfied with.

It's kind of like this process of forging something, shaping, crafting, sculpting in a way. Just an interesting observation that I've had. Not sure what I'll do with it but I think a lot of things in life are like this. Your skills, your body, your health, your businesses. So I think that I need to find more things where I'm doing this and that's how I can find my flow and that's how I can find my happiness.
