excerpt: "Reflecting on how people don't actually want AI, they want the automation it enables to free them from boring tasks."

With all the hype around AI lately, I've been thinking a lot about how people have completely conflated AI with automation. Everyone says they want "AI," like they're craving a little digital buddy or co-pilot that manages their day — something that just magically handles everything for them. But the truth is, people don't actually care about AI. They care about automation.

What people really want is freedom from the boring stuff. They don't want to spend their time doing the menial, repetitive, mentally draining tasks that pile up every day. Nobody wants to handle accounting. Nobody wants to manually write blog posts or create endless snippets of content just to stay active on social media. What people want is the result — not the process.

That's what AI has unlocked. It's not that AI itself is exciting to them — it's that AI automates the things they never wanted to do in the first place. It's the same reason agencies became successful: they took work off people's plates. AI is just a newer, cheaper, faster version of that same desire.

So instead of asking, "What kind of AI product can I build?" I should really be asking, "What can I automate for people that they don't want to do?" Because that's where the real leverage lies.

If I can identify the daily pain points that people quietly tolerate — the tasks they procrastinate on, the chores they push off, the workflows they dread — and then remove that pain entirely using modern tools (AI included), that's value. AI is simply the vehicle; automation is the destination.

These tools are becoming absurdly powerful, and whoever can pair them with a deep understanding of what people actually want to avoid doing will win. That's the game.
