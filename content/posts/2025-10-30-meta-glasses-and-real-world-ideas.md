title: Meta Glasses, Low-Stress Work, and Real-World Ideas

A little bit at a loss for what to talk about today, which I think is totally okay. I have a lot of thoughts.

I got my new Meta AI glasses yesterday. I wore them to Grace Cathedral to watch the light show, then turned them on while walking around San Francisco and going into the grocery store. Not going to lie—it's pretty cool. I'm fascinated by removing friction from processes. Before the glasses, you had to pull out your phone. Before that, your camera. The friction keeps decreasing as technology progresses. I love the idea that you can just look—still experience the moment as a human while capturing it with the capabilities of AI glasses.

It feels like a great way to start a YouTube or social channel. I'd need to find a niche. Maybe POV walking content in San Francisco is enough. Maybe people like those.

I keep thinking about how I might have one of the lowest-stress jobs in America. I get paid pretty darn well—maybe not compared to certain friends in SF, but comparison is the thief of joy. Compared to most of the world—early mornings, long commutes, physically demanding work, constant stress—my job is a 10 out of 10. The right way to think about work might be the income-to-stress ratio (with some minimum income, obviously). If a job pays $120–130k and has very low stress, I’d take that over $500k with relentless stress. My life wouldn’t change that much at the top end.

Everything’s up right now—assets, stocks, crypto. I’m nearly a millionaire at 30, which is something to be proud of. After taxes, maybe closer to $750k. Still, stress is a silent killer.

Idea-wise, I keep going back to real, in-person things—places and experiences. There are so many bars designed for people drinking alcohol. But where do people go if they’ve smoked weed, or taken shrooms or LSD? There should be a space designed for that state: chilled, darker, soft lights, comfortable couches or even floor mats, gentle music, good food, mellow vibes, no loudness, not centered on alcohol—just a place to be around others and hang out. It ties back to the “sweets” idea—a bar for other kinds of substances.

On the Meta glasses front: I’d love a way to easily clip videos without spending a ton of time editing. Maybe it’s just a 10–20 minute daily routine until I get good at it.

Another idea: Meta (Ray-Ban) glasses for baseball players. There’s probably a lot of valuable data to collect by wearing them during practice—seeing eye-tracking patterns, rehearsing in-game clips, identifying weaknesses, and creating feedback loops.

Not a fully formed day of thoughts, but it’s enough. Record, reflect, move forward.
