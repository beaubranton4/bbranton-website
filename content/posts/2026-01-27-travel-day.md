January 27, 2026 — Travel Day

Today was a travel day, but honestly, it still felt really solid.

I got in a nice five-mile run before the flight, which immediately set the tone. Ate my favorite breakfast—Mom's eggs Benedict—then headed out and had a smooth, easy flight. Watched a movie, read about two hours of Flowers for Algernon, and caught up on Jujutsu Kaisen. All things considered, that's a pretty great way to spend time in the air.

Once I landed, I had a nice dinner, grabbed some groceries, and actually put everything away instead of letting it sit around. Even though I was pretty gassed by the end of the day, it still felt productive in a quiet, sustainable way. I also intentionally took some time off my laptop, which felt necessary and earned.

I'm really looking forward to getting back to the grind tomorrow—learning, building, and trying out different projects again. There's still a lot to do on Dugout Edge, and I'm hoping to knock out a big chunk of it this week, along with a few other lingering to-do items.

More than anything, I want to keep the forward momentum going with good habits—or maybe more accurately, with the absence of bad ones. Adding clean eating into the mix feels important. I want to see how good I can feel mentally and physically if I actually give myself a fair shot at that. It kind of feels like I've been depriving myself of that baseline for a while. Maybe nothing dramatic happens. Maybe I'm still not exactly where I want to be. But I can already sense being a bit more clear-headed during the day, a little more motivated, a little steadier.

I still get those recurring feelings—that I'm not doing enough, that I'm procrastinating, that I'm being lazy or slacking. Those thoughts pop up a lot in the moment, during individual days or weeks. But when I zoom out and look back over longer stretches—Chile, Hawaii, other periods where I've really had time to lock in and focus—it's clear that I actually make a ton of progress. Even if it feels like I'm swimming through mud while it's happening.

So, in a way, the New Year starts now. January has been great, and I'm genuinely excited to pick up right where I left off and carry this momentum straight into February.
