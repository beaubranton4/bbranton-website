Not enough time in the day. Had a really productive day today, but still didn't have enough time to get everything that I wanted to get done. Ran to the gym this morning, got a great leg workout in. Came back, finished all my work that I needed to get done. Watched golf with dad. Made a ton of progress on the practice planner—won the simplified version of the practice planner. Went surfing. Watched a movie. Continue working on the practice planner.

I'm debating whether or not I should continue publishing these journal entries on my website. Obviously, I still want to do them, but I'm thinking that they're kind of weird to be publishing online. What has me second-guessing is my rejection from Anthropic. I included this website in my application and it instantly made me think—what if this was the reason? Probably wasn't the case, but it's just hard to know if someone comes across this. Maybe they'll be annoyed or just think it's weird. Maybe I'm just being scared. Is it like having an Instagram and posting five posts a day? On one hand, a lot of influencers do that, but then again, their content's probably pretty good. I'm not sure where I fall.

Maybe I just need to post high-quality thought pieces—like essays that I've really crafted and spent time on—as opposed to just pumping out peer numbers and content. TBD.

## Essay Idea: Surfing and Investing

I'd really like to write an essay about the parallels between surfing and investing. I think there's a lot of similarities between the two activities and how you can achieve success:

- **Waiting for the right wave, being patient.** Don't force trades or catches.
- **Picking the right surf spot to begin with.** Similar to picking the right niche, the right group of stocks.
- **If it's a bad day to go out, there's nothing wrong with staying at home and doing nothing.** Not surfing that day. You don't need to surf every single day to fall in love with it and be good at it.
- **Sometimes it's better to just sit on the shore and watch others.**
- **Different surfers have different objectives.** Some want to catch that one big wave. Others want to catch a bunch of little ones. It's all about how you position yourself.
- **The further out you swim, the earlier you get on, the more you'll get rewarded.** The closer into shore, closer to the break you get, the easier it is to catch. But the less rewarding the wave. And you have a bigger chance of getting run over by people.
