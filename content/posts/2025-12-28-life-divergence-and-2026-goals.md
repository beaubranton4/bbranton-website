It's fascinating how lives diverge. One moment you can all be in living the same life in college, hanging out. Years later, some are in the big leagues living under the microscope of fame while others fade into the crowd. 

Which one is better will depend on who you ask. I don't think one is inherently better than the other, but there are pros and cons to each.

I'm realizing that I'm starting to phase out of the phase in my life where all I want to do is go out and party and drink. I increasingly find that I want to wake up at 9 am on a Sunday and get my workout in and work through my list of chores. I'm not all that interested in playing the social game of who knows who.

I'm going to plan my 2026 goals today and this is top of mind:

- Using my time more wisely
- Being discipline
- Following my curiosity
- Finding time to relax (in a healthy way)
- I want to work on things that I am proud to tell others about, something I think is cool and am proud to share. Something that my kid can brag about


When I wake up each morning i need to "Be", "Become", "Begin".

Each morning needs to start slow, 10-15 minutes to simply be. Feel your body and move and awaken your mind and spirti. Then we can start thinking about what we want to become. There's no changing who we are in that very moment, but a vision of where we want to go and who we want to become can help inform your actions of the day. Once that is set, then we can begin.
