I've been working hard on Dugout Edge, building out the best baseball and softball specific practice planner in the world with a library of 200+ drills and over 30+ customizable templates.

I had a dream last night that all my teammates and people around the world were using it. Hundreds of people on launch day. I know in reality, it won't be the case. 

I need to start working on my marketing funnels while i build. A product without distribution is nothing. I did lay the SEO foundations by creating these pages months ago and building out the drill library, practice plans and templates and a "coming soon" version of the practice plan page.

This week, I will make it a goal to work on the SEO side of the practice planner and write a new article.

I've been reading a bunch and thinking a bunch about how quickly AI is advancing and what it means for me and how I need to position myself. Will agentic capabilities increase the demand of software and digital solutions or will it devalue software is the biggest question I'm trying to wrap my head around. 

the second I'm trying to wrap my head around is: what does a world where agents use 99% of software and digital infrastructure look like?where do humans fit in?

I think i just answered my own question in that the demand for software inevitably goes up because agents will be the ones using software 24/7, but then the question becomes

"WHAT DOES SOFTWARE FOR AGENTS LOOK LIKE? HOW DO AGENTS DISCOVER SOFTWARE? PROBABLY VIA SEO AND LLM? WHAT TYPES OF SOFTWARES WILL AGENTS NEED OR WANT TO USE?

These answers will lead to the most valuable creations.
