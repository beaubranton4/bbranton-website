Back from Dean's bachelor trip in New Orleans for the start of Mardi Gras. What a freakin bender of a time. Good fun—happy to be home. Those Canadian boys know how to get after it and are a racket. Some of the funniest wittiest guys I've met. A bit too much at the ripe age of 30 for me though haha.

**Day 1:** Land, grab a Guinness at the bar, fail to get groceries but got some beers. Meet the Canadians, power hour, then Bourbon Street pub crawl.

**Day 2:** Go-karting in the morning, swamp tour in the afternoon, nap, Narwhale, then dinner at Antoine's (amazing food and dinner in the private room)—had the Disney scene when you walk into the group talking about you when they didn't know. It was all positive things though which made me happy. Jazz bar, then wasted time at a casino, knocked over a plant and crawled out of an elevator.

**Day 3:** Sleep in late, crawfish boil, 7 trials, parade, Bourbon Street and a good time. Met a Black Beau, found the other Asians, caught an entire bag of the big beads (from an Asian) and hung with the college kids at the dance club.

**Day 4:** Home and Super Bowl and sleep.

Today I literally slept 3 hours from 1–4pm after sleeping 9 hours at night.
