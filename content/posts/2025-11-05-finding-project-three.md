I've been thinking a lot about what I should spend my time working on, what I should spend my time building. Should I continue with my current projects or should I find something new? Should I be doing something bigger? Should I be taking bigger swings or should I continue taking little swings, but pump out more quantity? Should I be diversifying or niching down?

These questions all circle around the same core topic: where do I want to direct my energy and focus?

## Where I Am Now

I'm currently working on **Dugout Edge**, which started as a simple tool to solve a single pain point: helping managers of baseball and softball teams generate fair lineups and fielding rotations for their youth teams. I'm now trying to grow it into more of a team management tool where coaches can also generate practice plans. As time goes on, I'd gradually build that out and add any revenue-generating features surrounding baseball and softball—equipment reviews with affiliate links, bat and cake directories, selling lineup cards, selling actual products, things like that.

There's a lot of competition in this space, but maybe it's a good place to play where it's not that big. Or maybe that's wishful thinking.

## The Tension

But I also think about the bigger swings I could be taking, especially now when advancements in AI are getting so good. Dugout Edge has nothing to do with AI, and I'm kind of like, maybe I'm missing the boat on building and using AI because there's probably so much low hanging fruit there.

At the same time, I think taking little swings could be the move too. I'm leveraging AI to build these little things—I can build like 10 times as many as if I didn't. Probably infinity many times because I didn't know how to code before. Should I, in typical indie hacker fashion, just build like these landing pages, these kind of one-solution products that convert? They probably won't make more than a thousand dollars MRR, but if I build 10 of them, I could probably replace my income.

Then there's also just the idea of building a hat company. For some reason, that one just keeps coming back to me and I'm just super interested in it. I think it would be super fun. And it could be super big. It also could be a super dumb idea and I could lose all my money. So I don't know if it's worth taking a risk on hats.

## The Decision Framework

What problems do I have? What am I equipped to solve? Who do I want to help? How can I help? What needs to exist in the world? **What do i have to give??**

These are the questions I need to answer, but right now I'm stuck in analysis paralysis. Do I go deep on one thing or wide on many? Do I chase the AI wave or build simple, focused tools? Do I follow the fun idea (hats) or stick to what I know (software)?

The truth is, I don't have a clear answer yet. But I'm going to start by brainstorming all the possibilities, organizing them by scale and ambition, and see what resonates.

Should it be something grand using AI? Data and data collection? What problems do I have? What am I equipped to solve? Who do I want to help? How can I help? What needs to exist in the world? Or should it be hats?

Another huge issue I face is when I have something related to my house or my car that's slightly complicated in nature that I need to hire an expert or professional to come check out. They have to come do an inspection, provide a quote, figure out what's wrong, and then they often quote on parts and labor. There's absolutely no way for me to know if they're scamming me or if they're telling the truth. And I'm sure this happens to a lot of different homeowners. How can I fix that problem? What is the solution here?
