It's 7 a.m., the sun's up, and it smells like a good day. I'm about to head inside, grab some breakfast, and pour myself a cup of coffee. I found this podcast this morning about Bill Gates — how he thinks about time, what he chooses to focus on, and how deliberate he is with his energy. It really made me think. I've always been pretty intentional with how I spend my time, but I feel like I could be even more specific — more ruthless, even — about aligning what I do with what I actually want long-term. I think that's where I need to step back for a bit and really evaluate: what am I working toward? What matters most? And how much of my day reflects that?

During my workout, I realized how powerful podcasts have been for me over the years. I've always been good at consuming information — listening, reading, absorbing ideas — but I also know that I learn best by doing. That's probably why lately I've found myself listening less and building more. The truth is, podcasts can easily become a form of procrastination for me. They feel productive — and they are, to an extent — but they can also distract me from actually doing the work. And as I've gotten deeper into my projects, I've noticed that cutting back on all that outside noise has helped. It's allowed me to think more clearly, focus better, and trust my own instincts.

The podcast this morning was about business analysis — the host was talking about all the tools he uses to evaluate companies. It reminded me that there's always another layer to learn, another way to improve. But it also made me realize how easy it is to get caught up in constant research and not enough execution. I definitely take breaks and let myself breathe — walk around, talk to people, read — but at the end of the day, it all comes back to the choices I make with my time.

Especially in something like baseball — or any niche industry — it's tempting to look at what others have done (like USA Baseball) and think, "I'll just rebuild that." But it's never that simple. Doing it well, doing it differently, doing it better — that's the hard part. Just like working out, the most challenging reps are the ones that actually build strength.

So, as I start this week, I want to focus on not giving in to distractions or procrastination. I want to live in the moment but also stay aligned with my purpose. Today isn't guaranteed, tomorrow isn't either. So I'll enjoy this morning, go outside, have fun, and do what excites me — because that's where my best work always comes from. Building this project, working out, being outdoors — these are the things that fill me up. And that's exactly how I want to spend my time.
