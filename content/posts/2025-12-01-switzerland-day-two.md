It's December 1st, 2025. Second day of our Switzerland trip. Missed two days of journaling for travel and obvious reasons for being jet lagged and tired. First day of a trip and just didn't feel like it.

We've been in Interlaken for about 40 hours. Got off the plane—16 hours of total travel time from SFO to Copenhagen to Zurich—and met up with the parents. Then took a train straight to Interlaken. Should've been about a 2.5 hour ride, but ended up taking about 3 because we had a bit of a mix up and got on the wrong train. Rode one stop and then the train announced "Next stop, airport." We just came from the airport, so we got out and rerouted. Made it to Interlaken eventually and got a $25 shawarma, of course. I'm still in pursuit of the 5 Riyal ($1.25) shawarma from the shawarma guy in Saudi outside the snackbar on Friday nights—that garlic sauce though.

Yesterday, we took a boat from Interlaken to Brienz, a cute little town right on the lake and we visited the Christmas market there. Walked along the little river walk, got some dank German/Swiss food with beer and watched some peculiar, maybe Amish men, build an A frame out of 20 foot long logs, put it on a wooden center pole so it spun around like someone spinning an umbrella. The 16 men then proceeded to get on the wooden structure and play patty cake while singing a song. They got off and drank warm beer. What is this called I wonder?

Today, we went to Jungfrau, the "top of Europe". Insane views. Never have seen such magnificent mountain faces in person. Makes you realize how small you are compared to this world. Might have been my first time in sub-zero temperatures and 30 km/h winds. Well worth it. Amazing views and memories going up the Gondola and visiting the ice palace. 

In awe of the Swiss engineering. Everything mechanical just seems to work so much smoother here. Enjoying and cherishing time with family.
