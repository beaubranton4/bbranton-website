The date is November 10, 2025. It was a beautiful day out in San Francisco today. I grabbed a croissant from Arsicault and a coffee and worked in Golden Gate Park. Ideal day while working. I cannot emphasize how lucky I am to have the job I do, living in the time I do, living in the place I do.

The only real big step change improvement I can make is by starting my own company, so my level of wealth has the potential of 100x'ing and I can take control of my own time. Anything else is simply not worth it.

I tried two video recordings of myself today, but I don't have the system created yet to take the video, transcribe it, and post as both a daily journal and in video form. I will be honest though. It's much more difficult for me to speak on camera than it is to record a voice note. I just need to practice it more.

So that's why I think I should practice doing this on video, just so I can get better at it. Building that system will be key for me and using a CDN so I'm not just uploading ten-minute videos into GitHub every single day.

I'm much better at writing or just speaking. I wonder if that's because I have to care about what I look like? Because it's faster than writing? I feel like when I write my thoughts get solidified a bit more. My thinking is more structured than when I speak. Interesting thing to think about when deciding on format for daily journal entries.
