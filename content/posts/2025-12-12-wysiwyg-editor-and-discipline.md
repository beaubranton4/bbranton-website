excerpt: 'Up at 5am again, enjoying the quiet morning. Spent all day building the practice planner, first creating an overly complicated version, then simplifying it to a WYSIWYG editor. Reflecting on discipline as the number one priority and how good habits create a chain of benefits.'

Yet again! i'm awake at 5am typing into a machine. But to be honest, i really enjoy the quiet and calm of this part of the day. For some reason I feel energized and motivated to take on the hardest tasks of the day. 

I spent almost all of yesterday building out the practice planner. The 1st half of the day was building out all the functionality that I think is absolutely necessary. I ended up deciding it was way too overly complicated. Here is what the 1st version looked like.

I then spent the next half of the day to simplify so that the editor looks much more similar to the ouput. I learned this is called a "what you see is what you get editor" (WYSIWYG). Here is what that version looks like.

What do you think?

My first thought of the day is that my number 1 priority is discipline. Training that muscle so that it gets stronger. Discipline in one area of life will carry over to all the others. Eat better -> Have more energy -> workout more -> stronger -> more self-esteem -> better mood -> less time doom scrolling -> more time focused on what matters. This chain of benefits can be extended to almost any good habit or the negation of bad habits. We all know what those are.

For me, journaling has been what of those good habits that is reinforcing discipline. It is therapeutic, it makes me a clearer thinker, I have a daily journal to look back on, and the list goes on. At this point, journaling feels like second nature to me. Maybe there's some science to back this, but I am reaching the 100 day mark. Is that when something becomes a habit?
