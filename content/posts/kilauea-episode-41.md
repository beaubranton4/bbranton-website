I witnessed the historic Episode 41 of the Kilauea eruptions on the Big Island of Hawaii. Here's how it all unfolded.

## The Seed of an Idea

**January 14, 2026**

I was sitting on the couch with Mom, just chatting. She's getting older—more forgetful, asking me the same questions repeatedly. Both her parents succumbed to dementia and Alzheimer's, so I worry she's starting down that path. It's not awful yet, but there are signs, and it's heartbreaking.

During our conversation, she mentioned something that would change our weekend plans: "You know, one of my bucket list items is to watch a volcano erupt on the Big Island in person." She told me about Episode 40 on January 12th—the largest fountaining episode in the current eruption series.

For context: Kilauea has been erupting since December 2024, with eruptions coming in spurts lasting 6-12 hours, spaced one to two weeks apart. There have been 41 episodes to date across 14 months. Each episode features spectacular fountaining—lava shooting hundreds of feet from the earth's crust.

I filed Mom's comment away, not thinking much of it at the time.

I remember in the 3rd grade i went on a field trip to the desert. I took a rock home with me. My mom, who grew up in Hawaii was very superstitious. She told us that you never take rocks from the outside into your home. Stemming from the stories of the Hawaiian goddes of Volcanoes - Pele. 

How this applied to a rock in the middle of Saudi Arabia, i have no idea, but mom made us drive 2 hours back to the desert (the exact spot we had taken it from) and we threw the rocks out of the car into the sand.

**January 15, 2026**

Mom brought it up again: "Seeing the volcano erupt in person has always been a dream of mine. There was a really big eruption a few days ago, did you hear about it?"

Being the good son I am, I did some research. The eruptions happen one to two weeks apart, but there's no proven way to predict when the next one will occur. The best alert system is through USGS, which sends email updates using a color-coded scale. At that moment, the eruption had ended on January 12th with no current activity.

I signed up for alerts and told Mom it would be difficult to predict, but I'd monitor the situation. "Abby gets here next week, so maybe we can wait for her and hopefully it happens while she's visiting. We could fly over last minute if needed."

## The Alert

**January 20, 2026**

I had completely forgotten about the volcano alerts—I hadn't received any notifications. When I checked, I realized I hadn't subscribed correctly. But an alert had come out that morning: seismic activity indicated an eruption would possibly start within 2-5 days.

I started researching Airbnbs, Turo rentals, and plane tickets. The damage: $1,200-1,500 all-in for four people. Worth considering.

**January 21, 2026**

Another alert: eruption expected between January 22-25. That was our last weekend on Oahu with Abby. Decision time.

Prices had jumped to $2,000 all-in for a three-day trip. Fuck it—let's book.

## The Chase Begins

**January 22, 2026**

I built an alert system using Claude that would notify me via push notification and blaring laptop sounds as soon as USGS sent an alert or changed the color code. It worked perfectly, going off right in the airport. The window had tightened to January 23-25. Perfect timing.

We flew from Oahu to Hilo, landing at 8 PM. Grabbed our rental—a beautiful white 2023 Toyota Tacoma from Turo—and drove 45 minutes through dark, rainy roads to our Airbnb. Stopped by safeway for weekend supplies since Volcano Village doesn't really have anything. The drive was sketchy, but the destination was worth it: a gorgeous A-frame house tucked in the jungle, just five minutes from Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. This proximity would prove crucial.

Around 10 PM, after settling in and Abby tucking into bed, I checked the livestream. There was lava coming out of the ground. We rallied and headed to the national park in the dead of night.

We parked at Kilauea Overlook and hiked to Uekahuna. The overflow was small—only 10 feet high—but mesmerizing. We thought we were watching "the eruption." Ha! This was just the warm-up.

Back to bed at 1 AM. Had to be up at 5:30 for work.

**January 23, 2026**

A calm day working from the Airbnb. Volcanic activity had subsided, so we enjoyed the peaceful sounds of birds and jungle breeze. I worked on Dugout Edge while lounging in the hammock and playing ping pong with Dad. We explored the Thurston Lava Tubes (now called Nahaku Lava Tubes) and had dinner at the historic Volcano House.

No signs of major fountaining, just small overflow. We called it an early night in case the alarm sounded. I slept nine hours—didn't realize how exhausted we were from the anticipation and travel.

## The Main Event

**January 24, 2026 - 7:00 AM**

Woke up at 7 AM. No alerts! I checked the livestream—whoa, it looked bigger. Lava was definitely flowing, but not erupting yet. When I checked the website, there were three alerts from overnight that my bot had missed:

> **Kilauea Message 2026-01-22 23:22:08 HST**  
> A second small overflow from the north vent began at 11:13 pm HST and died within 2-3 minutes. Additional precursory overflows are expected prior to the start of episode 41 fountaining forecast for January 23-25.

> **Kilauea Message 2026-01-24 06:03:06 HST**  
> The north vent has been overflowing continuously since 3:52 am HST. Spatter fountains grew to 10-15 feet high with an increase in effusion rate at about 4:47 am. Lava overflowed the south vent twice for a few minutes at 3:11 and 5:18 am.

> **Kilauea Message 2026-01-24 06:18:42 HST**  
> Small fountains became visible in the south vent just before 6 am HST and another short overflow occurred from 6:13-6:16 am. Overflows continue from the north vent.

Argh! But in hindsight, it was great—no eruption alert yet and we got a full night's rest.

We debated whether to stick around or continue with our plan to explore Hilo. We decided to stick to our plan. Lava looks much better at night anyway due to the contrast.

**9:00 AM - Hilo Adventures**

Drove to Hilo Farmer's Market for breakfast. Had an incredible ube sourdough cinnamon roll and coffee. Delicious.

Then we hit Rainbow Falls (pretty underwhelming—no rainbow! And we had to pay before realizing Kama'aina was free). Took a 10-minute detour to check out Uncle Mark's house, which prompted us to make the 45-minute drive to Akaka Falls.

**11:30 AM - When Everything Changed**

We were driving along Hilo's beautiful Heritage Coast when the madness started. The alerts came rapid-fire:

> **Kilauea Message 2026-01-24 10:47:24 HST**  
> The south vent has been overflowing continuously since 10:07 am HST. Sustained dome fountains 10-20 feet (3-6 meters) high at both vents are feeding precursory lava flows out into the middle of Halema'uma'u crater.

> **Kilauea Message 2026-01-24 11:12:02 HST**  
> Precursory overflows continue from both vents with increasing fountains. Summit tilt on UWD began slow deflation at 10:15 that is continuing and tremor is increasing rapidly. Episode 41 fountaining has started.

> **Kilauea Message 2026-01-24 11:54:28 HST**  
> Episode 41 started at 11:10 a.m. As of 11:50 a.m., both north and south vents are over 250 m (820 feet) high, and the summit tilt on UWD has already recorded 3.5 microradians of deflation.

We had just left Akaka Falls when I got the 11:12 alert on my Garmin. I didn't think it meant anything—"precursory overflows" were the same terms used for what we'd seen two nights prior.

**11:54 AM - The Moment of Truth**

Then I got THE notification: "Episode 41 started at 11:12 HST."

God dammit. I knew it.

We were still 45 minutes from the park and had to pick up lunch. I checked the livestream—it was roaring. Big time. We thought 10-foot spews were impressive, but this thing was at 600 feet and growing. By the time we picked up food and were driving to the park, the fountain had reached its peak around 1,600 feet. (I didn't realize it at the time, but this was a record for this eruption series and the largest fountain height in 40 years.)

I was fuming, kicking myself for not staying at the Airbnb. We would have been at the park by now, catching this historic moment. Real lava flowing from the earth into the sky. And we missed it. Who knew if we'd be able to catch any of it?

**12:13 PM - The Sky is Falling**

Ten minutes from the park, another alert came in:

> **Kilauea Message 2026-01-24 12:13:51 HST**  
> Tephra fall from episode 41 has been reported in public viewing areas within the National Park, Volcano Village and Mauna Loa Estates and Highway 11. Please follow the advice of the Park and Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency.

"What the hell is tephra fall?" I wondered.

That's when we noticed ash falling from the sky. At first, it looked like large specks of dust floating—like something from Pokémon when you're in a volcano town. So cool! We were witnessing volcanic ash falling from the sky.

Five minutes from the national park entrance, we heard thuds. "Is it raining?" 

Holy shit—it was raining rocks.

Cars started pulling over and making U-turns. It was literally hailing rocks, some the size of baseballs and cantaloupes, pounding our car. We called Uncle Mark, but he had no idea what was happening. He said this wasn't common.

I was starting to panic as the one driving the rental car. With so many cars U-turning, we pulled over. We collectively decided not to get closer. We were only three minutes from the park entrance, but the closer we got, the worse the "tephra fall" became.

The truck bed was covered in rocks, and our windshield was pelted. I grabbed a piece—it felt light but rugged. It wouldn't seriously injure you but could definitely cut you up. This was insane. The sky was literally falling.

We took a side road and booked it back to our Airbnb, stopping at a local store where dozens of people sheltered under the porch. The lady there said she'd lived there 35 years and had never seen anything like it. She told us there was no way they were letting people into the park, but that the lava fountain could be seen from the volcano golf course.

**12:30 PM - Back to Safety, Heartbroken**

We made it back to the Airbnb as rocks continued falling. It seemed to lighten up once we got there—apparently just outside the tephra fall zone.

Everyone was happy we made it back safe, but I was distraught. Did we just miss our chance to see the eighth wonder of the world? We were literally three minutes away, and a little ash stopped us?

I frantically switched between the livestream, alerts, and Twitter. Radio silence.

**12:59 PM - More Bad News**

> **Kilauea Message 2026-01-24 12:59:35 HST**  
> Tephra fall from episode 41 has been reported as far as Fern Acres, and is continuing in nearby communities, on HWY 11 and within Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park. Please follow the advice of the Park & Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency.

What did it mean? Could we go into the park? The livestream still showed tephra raining down. I checked Facebook—people were saying the park was closing. Highway 11 was closed both ways. It was the first time the park had closed since 2018. Hawai'i volcanoes national park is open 24/7, 365 days of the year.

FML. Our dream—my mom's dream—of seeing an eruption live might never come true. We choked.

**2:00 PM - 3:30 PM - Desperation and Hope**

Time for a nap. Let's just hope they reopen later.

Still waiting around, watching golf. Even if the park was closed, I wondered if there was another way in. I was grasping at straws, checking Instagram stories, Facebook, even downloading Snapchat to use their map feature.

Somehow I came across this guy who seemed to have played out the same timeline as us—but he was in the park! He had parked on the highway and trekked in, though he was eventually kicked out.

Now we were scheming.

**3:30 PM - Rally the Troops**

I had an idea: "Let's park at Lanikai Brewing and see if we can hike into the park."

**3:45 PM - Highway 11 Chaos**

We arrived at Highway 11 to find a chaotic scene. Cars parked on the roadside, tephra fall covering everything (though no longer raining from the sky). Street sweepers had cleared most of the highway, and cars were driving slowly but steadily.

We drove past the entrance point and saw an employee blocking the road. I pulled over to talk to someone.

First, we spoke with some Australians who said no one was allowed in the park—they'd been trying for two hours. Then Dad walked over to talk to the employee, a true local braddah. He was straight with us: "I'm here now, but I won't be here all night. They probably won't be able to clear the roads in the park until 2 AM. Cars are slipping and sliding."

He recommended going up Mauna Loa Road and driving all the way up the "strip road" past the bird park. "That or the volcano golf course—best spots to see the lava fountains from outside the park."

We thanked him for being a chiller and headed on our way.

At this point, it seemed our best chance was waiting until late at night to see the volcano up close. Then IT STARTED POURING RAIN. We opted to take his advice and try the golf course first. Other people had the same idea—the lot was crowded with an employee fending people off, telling them to leave.

Mauna Loa Road it was.

**4:45 PM - The Ascent**

We drove up a winding road that reminded us of Tantalus—this had to be right because we were going up. It was a 45-minute drive, with 25 minutes on a one-way road.

Halfway up, we saw people walking on the roadside and about half a dozen parked cars. A bit further, a group of about a dozen people stared out into the distance.

HOLY SHIT—you could see the lava from here!

I spotted it in my rearview mirror as I made a sharp U-turn. Thanks, braddah—good advice. There wasn't much room for us, but this wasn't the lookout point he'd mentioned. We kept driving up.

About a mile down the one-way strip road, going 10 mph with not a car in sight, we passed a red Mazda. We got her attention, and on the narrow road, both rolled our windows down. She'd been up there for about three hours and hadn't seen much—too cloudy, not a great view.

We turned around and opted for the lookout where everyone else was gathered. We found a cutout and parked illegally. There were twice as many cars now.

**5:30 PM - The Eighth Wonder of the World**

We joined the group of onlookers on the hill, watching the monstrosity of a lava fountain continue to breathe fire. The most magnificent part was watching the plume of smoke—apparently 20,000+ feet in the sky—expand and rise higher and higher.

Three or four folks had professional cameras. We traded stories. A few of them (the annoying know-it-alls) had actually made it into the park before getting escorted out by police. They showed us pics of the eruption while they were in the cop car—hilarious.

**6:30 PM - Awestruck Silence**

We'd been standing there in awe for an hour. The sun had gone down, and the burning fountain of lava was even more magnificent in the dark. Nobody was talking anymore.

**6:45 PM - The Game Changer**

A lady parked nearby with a red Subaru suddenly announced: "I just got an alert! The park is open!"

Before we could listen to people debate, we took off. By the time we were in the car, the lady in the red Subaru was already gone.

**6:53 PM - Racing Against Time**

We arrived at the park entrance just eight minutes after the announcement. Only the road from the entrance to the military camp—a small portion of the park—was open. We must have been among the first in, because I could see a huge line piling up behind us while we had a relatively clear path.

Employees directed traffic with air traffic control light cones. We could see the lava fountain as we drove in. There was no way this was actually happening.

We got directed to a small parking lot at the military camp with quite a bit of space. Jackets on, lights ready, we were pumped. Employees directed us across Crater Rim Road to a lookout point. We had no idea where we were—just following the herd of people in the pitch dark, stepping through mud and puddles, getting closer and closer.

**7:05 PM - The Moment of a Lifetime**

That's when we saw it. Through the trees.

As we climbed under a small gate and up a hill, the lava emerged. It was like nothing I had ever seen in my life. Seeing it from afar had been spectacular, but being up close, standing on the rim of Halema'uma'u crater, was indescribable.

You could hear the lava roaring like molten fire waves crashing on a shore of jagged rocks. The darker-than-dark night was illuminated by the fountain of lava piercing earth and sky like an arrow shot from the ground. Over a mile of ground glowed with flowing lava like a checkerboard of orange and black.

We had finally made it. We were seeing the volcano erupt 600 feet into the sky right before our eyes, standing on ground created by this very same volcano.

**7:15 PM - Perfect Positioning**

We found the perfect little ledge to stand on—me, Abby, Mom, and Dad. We all had perfect, unobstructed views. Phones came out, capturing everything. Fifteen more minutes of absolute silence. Selfies. Smiling. Hugging.

One of the top moments of my life, shared with my favorite people.

**7:29 PM - The Grand Finale**

The lava was fountaining, and then it started fountaining more. It hissed and roared, and all you could think was "there's no way it's getting bigger."

And then... nothing. It stopped.

All that remained were the remnants of the past eight hours on the crater floor. The eruption had ended.

We stood there for another ten minutes. Nothing. Then we got the alert:

> **Kilauea Message 2026-01-24 19:41:13 HST**  
> Episode 41 ended abruptly at 7:29 pm. North vent fountaining ended at 7:26 pm, and south vent followed suit 3 minutes later. Tephra fall may continue for several hours as ash settles out of the atmosphere.

It was over. The sky glowed an orange-red color I'd never seen before. In some ways, it was more beautiful than the eruption itself.

**8:30 PM - Perfect Celebration**

We floated out of the park and drove back to our cozy Airbnb. Frozen pizza popped in the oven. We cracked open the pack of Guinnesses we'd bought at Safeway a few nights earlier—the perfect celebration for a roller coaster of a day with the most incredible ending. It all worked itself out. 

Lady luck was on our side. In hindsight, we were lucky to not catch the eruption in the park during the day. 1) we would have been lit up by the tephra fall. 2) if we saw it during that brief period i doubt we would have tried to see it all again after being ushered out of the park.

The braddah who gave us the advice to drive up mauna loa road

The lady in the red mazda who told us to turn around instead of going to the top

deciding to stay until there was absolute darkness

the lady in the red subaru who shouted to the entire group of onlookers that the park had opened

The fact that we all got to see the highest fountaining

the fact that we found the perfect spot for the 4 of us in the trees.

the fact that we didn't leave to try and find a different spot. 

the fact that we saw the absolute end of episode 41 at 7:29pm HST

you can't make these sorts of things up.

We had witnessed Episode 41 from start to finish. We'd experienced the raw power of Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of volcanoes, in all her glory. Mom got her bucket list wish. We all did.

Thank you, Pele.
