Yesterday’s marathon session inside SEMrush left me with five viable concepts and a tangled mind.

1. Funny cards e-commerce store
2. Workout Hats
3. lymphatic massage directory site (https://booksy.com/)
4. Cooler Rental
5. Saving snowflake costs on data refresh and maintaining data pipelines

Today I want clarity. It’s wildly tempting to spin up landing pages for workout hats, funny cards, or a lymphatic massage directory, but the paradox of choice is real. Each idea looks reasonable on paper, yet I keep sensing that if I try to chase all of them, I’ll never give any one of them the focus it deserves.

I started the morning by re-reading the notes I dumped into yesterday’s entry. The keyword data still excites me—especially the workout hat opportunity and the conversion-friendly “near me” phrases—but I also recognized how analytical the exercise was. I let volume, CPC, and difficulty dictate the short list without asking if the day-to-day grind of those businesses actually fuels me. It reminded me that data is a compass, not the destination.

 I already bought a domain for funny cards, funnydaycards.com, which I think can be used as a landing page for some of these funny greeting cards, birthday cards, graduation cards. I think it's a good idea. I can use AI to generate the content and the cards and honestly it's not that hard to print and ship or maybe even buy a machine, ship them out myself. 
 
Next I want to brainstorm building things will be helpful to me. I think that for a lot of these ideas I've listed, I've used my analytical hat. I've looked at the data. I've assessed. I've found that they're kind of tangentially related to something that I'm interested in, maybe not something that I'm super passionate about and maybe not a pain point that I necessarily am dying to solve. So let me name some of those ideas in case that might give me some, these are maybe like I'm looking for three last ditch ideas and then maybe do some SEM rush research again while I have the tool. 

So here's that section for that:


1. A community centered around playing games
2. To-Do List/Journal/AI Agent
3. Finding reasonable home repair quote without spending time and getting scammed


And then one last attempt at - problems i face as a data analyst/professional:

1.
2.
3.

Then need to do keyword research

Once I have this final list of items and ideas to work on, I should do a little bit of research and then that'll help me pick, you know, which one to really focus on here. I think I should also ultimately just, I think I should just go for one really. I can keep the others on the back burner, maybe by the website, maybe spin it up just to see if it starts ranking for any articles. But I think I should really have an order and focus on one.

I'm still really struggling with whether or not I need to just focus on dugout edge. If I need to expand that or if i should hedge my bets, just try out some of these other ideas. A lot of these ideas are simpler ideas where the product is not necessarily as difficult to build, although they, a lot of them do have more of a real life component to them. So I will need to eventually create a card or eventually create a hat or contact real massage studios that do lymphatic massages or actually have a cooler and store those coolers and load those coolers with ice. Although I can partner with companies like REI, Sports Basement, etc. to store or supply those. Yeah, I'm not 100% sure. Do I pick one? Do I pick few? Do I go for them all? It's the paradox of choice.

Should I pick any of these ideas? I know workout hats is a personal pain point of mine. It's like good looking, good fitting, hats created and designed for working out. So maybe that's where I start. Maybe I just go all in on dugout edge, right? All of this time that I'm putting into some of these other websites, I could definitely be putting into dugout edge.

I'm also kind of struggling with the question, should I take many small swings? Build little internet tools like the lineup generator, maybe some of these other websites and just let them ride. They're almost like little businesses on autopilot. Or do I build something bigger where I have real customers paying me real money and my ass is on the line, but the potential for profit is way larger. I don't know. I don't know. Hit singles or hit dingers?
