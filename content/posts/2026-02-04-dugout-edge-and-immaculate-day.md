Forgot to do yesterday's journal entry again. I wonder if it's because I mentally committed to not posting these articles publicly that my mind has deprioritized this subconsciously. Just something interesting to think about.

I've been making a ton of progress on Dugout Edge. Built an entire emailing admin portal via Resend API. Shitty thing is I still have to pay if I want to do more than 3,000 emails a month or more than 100 emails a day. There's got to be some sort of free solution, but it doesn't seem like there's anything super easy to build. And it's just one of those things like Stripe—might as well go with a paid solution. So I built that. Built a bunch of email automations: welcome email, some churn mitigation emails. I guess that's kind of what I built yesterday.

Prior to that, I increased pricing to $8 a month or $60 a year. Already have two signups, which is great. So already telling me that I can increase pricing without much pushback so far. You know, that's just two cases, but I haven't had anyone hit the paywall yet and decline.

Published two articles about dugout organization. This will kind of be my first step—dipping my toes into equipment for coaches. I think that this could be another big revenue stream for me. I'm seriously considering buying the Bench Coach Dugout Organizer, which is a premium dugout organizer that costs about $260 retail, from the owner of the business who built it almost 20 years ago.

Heading to New Orleans tomorrow, so we'll be taking some time off. Hopefully we'll get to build out functionality where the templates and practice plans that are displayed on my website kind of go right into the funnel. We'll see how that works out. I need to kind of brainstorm what the best option there is.

Yesterday was an absolutely immaculate day in San Francisco. Spent the morning—started the morning with a five mile run, quick arm workout in the gym, strong breakfast, and then headed over to Chilquettes for some coffee and some work in the sun. Then I went to the gym, biked to Alta Plaza, continued working out there until about 2, 3 p.m. Came home, took a quick nap, caught up on some Hell's Paradise, and then got back to work on Dugout Edge. Honestly, it was almost a perfect day for me. Got to bed around 10:20, 10:30. The only thing that wasn't perfect was that I had about three cups of coffee, which really messed up my sleep last night and made me feel kind of gross throughout the day. Although I did have a ton of energy and I was motivated, so it's tough. There's a balance.

One final thought to leave for myself: whatever I decide to devote myself to—and right now that's Dugout Edge, that's my personal fitness, that's having fun and enjoying life—I shouldn't be banking on a trend or the fact that I'm early to something. I think I need to bank more on my hard work and my work ethic and my unburdened determination and focus.

Double down on these little web apps. Search engines love them. There are so many questions that are answered best by intuitive software as opposed to a Google search, or even asking an LLM. These are the websites that are going to win. They're specialized help, not generalized. ChatGPT is a generalist.
