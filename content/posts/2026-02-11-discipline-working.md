I can start to feel things working.

The discipline I've been building across so many facets of my life is actually paying off. Not in the obvious, flashy ways. I'm not suddenly jacked. I'm not suddenly rich. There's no overnight transformation. But I feel good. Steady. Clear. Aligned.

Every day I'm knocking out what's on my to-do list. I'm executing. I'm following through. And that alone creates this quiet confidence that's hard to describe. My sleep score is up. I'm getting more meaningful work done on Dugout Edge. I feel better throughout the day—less foggy, less reactive, more intentional.

It's really just the basics. Cutting out the junk. Less screen time. Less TV. No mindless scrolling. No unhealthy food. Getting real sleep. Going to bed early. No nicotine. No smoking. All the cliché advice your parents drill into you when you're a kid. They were right.

It just takes 15 or 20 years of living to actually internalize why they were right.

And don't get me wrong—I literally just came back from a bachelor trip where I did the opposite of all of this. Drinking, late nights, chaos. But that contrast almost makes it clearer. I'm back on track now, and I feel better than ever. The delta is obvious. Productivity is up. Mood is up. Energy is up.

I want to remember this feeling. Bottle it. Because this is the version of me that compounds. This is the version that builds real things.

I'm also feeling a lot of gratitude. The setup I've had at UserTesting for the last five or six years has been unbelievable. Remote work. Flexibility. Stability. I genuinely don't know if it gets much better than this. And I know it won't last forever. Nothing does. So I'm trying to appreciate it while I have it instead of anxiously trying to escape it.

It's baseball season again, which always feels like a reset. I'm genuinely excited to watch college baseball. There's something about the rhythm of the season that grounds me.

And Dugout Edge signups are picking up. Over the last five days, I've gotten two or three new customers every single day. That's not viral growth. It's not TechCrunch headlines. But it's real people. Real coaches. Real teams. That feels good.

Opus 4.6 launching has helped a lot too. Honestly, I think the jump from 4 to 4.5 was bigger than 4.5 to 4.6, but it's still impressive. The tools are getting sharper. I can build faster. Iterate faster. Think faster. That leverage is real.

And I'm thankful I chose to build in baseball.

There's so much doom and gloom around AI right now. Especially in San Francisco. Especially on Twitter. The echo chamber is loud. It feels like every other post is about the end of knowledge work, the collapse of white-collar jobs, the extinction of desk workers in big tech.

And part of me believes it.

It really does feel like the traditional knowledge worker role is under threat. I don't know how much longer the "big tech employee pushing Jira tickets" archetype survives in its current form. Maybe I'm early. Maybe I'm just marinating in the algorithm's anxiety. But the pace of change is undeniable.

At the same time, baseball is physical. It's real people on real fields with real equipment. It requires physical goods. Human coordination. In-person relationships. That feels at least a little more defensible than building yet another generic B2B SaaS tool in an industry that AI can replicate overnight.

Who knows if that's true. But it feels directionally right.

Still, I can't help but wonder whether the skills I've spent the last decade building—SQL, dashboards, analytics, automation—will transfer cleanly into whatever the next era of work looks like. Or whether they'll be table stakes. Or obsolete.

Maybe the most important skills going forward are things like human connection. Ownership of assets. Distribution. Community. Applying leverage intelligently. Being able to see patterns and act decisively.

Human intelligence is still human intelligence. Hard work still compounds. That has to count for something.

But the future feels like a black box.

I'm afraid, if I'm being honest. Afraid of being caught flat-footed. Afraid of being too early. Afraid of being too late.

And at the same time, I'm deeply curious.

The world is moving so fast. It's insane. We're standing on the shoulders of giants—millions of people who wrote blog posts, open-sourced code, published research, tweeted ideas. All of it turned into training data. All of it distilled into these models that can now reason, write, build, and accelerate everything.

Each person contributed some infinitesimal fraction of signal. One-trillionth of a datapoint. And now it's this compounding intelligence layer sitting on top of humanity.

These models are going to help the world in profound ways. Increase productivity. Unlock creativity. Accelerate medicine. Democratize access to knowledge.

And they're going to hurt in some ways too. Displace people. Reshape industries. Break identities that were built around certain kinds of work.

I don't know exactly where I'll land in all of it.

But right now, I feel disciplined. I feel clear. I feel grateful. I feel like I'm building something real. I feel like I'm taking ownership of my path instead of waiting for the system to define it for me.

And that's enough for today.
