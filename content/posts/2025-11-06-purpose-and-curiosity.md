The date is November 6, 2025. I've been thinking a lot about purpose. What is my purpose? When you have purpose, the rest comes easy. You know exactly what to do at any given time. You have a beacon, you have a lighthouse, a guiding light to take steps toward. I'd rather be on a slow boat sailing in the right direction over a fast boat going the opposite direction.

It really is such an existential question. What is your purpose? I don't know how to find it. I don't know if I found mine, but I know that one thing that I can do to find my purpose is to follow my curiosity. And one thing that is stopping me from following my curiosity is short dopamine hits in the form of social media, in the form of maybe certain substances. Because when I do these certain things that give me quick dopamine hits, it sucks the motivation out of me. And with no motivation, I have no incentive or I have no driving force that compels me to even try and find my purpose. So the quicker that I can stop doing these unhealthy things, the faster I can start taking steps towards finding my purpose. And then all of the problems that I have will start to go away in the sense that I won't be questioning what I work on next, what do I do now.

So those are just some of the thoughts that I've had today. Funny enough, this was spurred by my boss's boss, Marty, who provided us with some of these things to think about in our all hands meeting today. What is your purpose within the company? You have purpose, things come easy. So really just taking a step back and questioning what is your purpose. Maybe that's not a philosophical life kind of question, more of like in your work, what is your purpose. But I think the same thing can apply to my entrepreneurship endeavors or my life in general.

A bit of a side note. Practice makes perfect. If you don't use it, you lose it. So I've really enjoyed the process of speaking into these voice memos, into ChatGPT, into audio recordings, whatever, to record my daily journals because I think that it's improving my speaking skills. I think the next thing I need to do and take it the notch up is to speak on camera. And I would love to become a better public speaker and I think the only way to do that is to practice. And now when I think about that, where can I apply that in my life to help other people practice things that they want to improve upon? What sorts of tools can I build? I'm thinking along the lines of a public speaking coach where you have daily challenges, you speak for five minutes at a time and you get a grade and you do it daily. You get rankings, compete with friends, you get a score and you have your streaks, some sort, or gamify the practice. And people will get better just by doing the action. Maybe this can be applied to creating content or maybe it can be applied to coding. There are so many things that people need to practice but they don't have a means to practice. I didn't have the means to practice speaking every day until I decided, "Hey, I can use daily journal as an excuse to practice speaking."
