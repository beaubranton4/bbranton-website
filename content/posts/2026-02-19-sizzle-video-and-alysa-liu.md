It's funny how I keep skipping these journal entries in increments of two. I don't know if that's intentional or if I just naturally fall into an every-other-day rhythm. Either way, here we are again.

Yesterday was one of those oddly intense days where most of the energy went into something that, on the surface, seems trivial. I spent an embarrassing amount of time debating whether or not to spend $30 on that screen recording software—I can't even remember the exact name. ScreenEdit? Screen something. It's the one that adds the smooth mouse movement, the subtle zoom-ins, the polished effects that make everything look crisp and professional. The kind of thing that makes a demo feel like a product and not just a hacked-together Loom.

It's funny how $30 can feel heavy when it's attached to an idea. Not because I can't afford it, but because it represents a commitment. If I buy it, I'm saying: I'm serious about this. I'm going to make content. I'm going to market this thing properly.

And then I went down the rabbit hole.

I spent so much time trying to figure out how to create a proper sizzle video—a highlight reel that actually captures what matters. It's harder than it looks. You want to include everything. Every feature. Every clever detail. Every button you painstakingly built. But that's not how it works. It's basically directing a film. You have to decide what matters. You have to cut scenes you're emotionally attached to. You have to tell a story.

You've got five to ten seconds to hook someone. That's it.

No one is sitting there dying to watch a one-minute short film about your web app. They're scrolling. They're distracted. They're half-bored, half-curious. You either earn the next three seconds or you don't.

I ended up getting something out the door—redesigned the homepage, tightened up some copy, dropped in the video. It felt good to ship something, even if it's not perfect. But as soon as I stepped back, I realized the video is still too long. A minute is generous in my head, but in reality it's an eternity.

So today's goal is clear: condense it to 15 seconds.

Just the key selling points. The "oh, that's cool" moments. The things that make someone click. Strip everything else away. It's almost like lifting—progressive overload, but for clarity. Remove fluff. Increase signal. Make it punchy.

After that, I need to crank out more content. Not just one polished hero video, but supporting pieces. Short clips for the site. How-to walkthroughs. Stuff I can throw on YouTube. Maybe even cut into shorts. Marketing isn't one big swing; it's a steady drumbeat. I know this. I preach this. Now I just need to execute it consistently.

It's been raining a ton in San Francisco lately. Real rain. The kind that makes everything gray and slightly heavier. It's never fun when it rains here—the city doesn't feel built for it. You can't really get outdoors the same way. Everything feels a bit muted.

But honestly, I don't feel muted.

If anything, I feel steady.

The discipline piece is starting to compound. Abby and I have been on a solid rhythm—waking up early, getting workouts in, eating clean, trying to hit 10K steps a day. Not rotting on the couch every night. That's a big one. It's so easy to default to comfort. To tell yourself you've earned it. And sometimes you have. But we've been choosing movement more often than not.

That feels good.

Today I watched Alysa Liu win the gold medal in women's freestyle skating. And there was something about it that hit me. Watching someone dedicate their entire life to a craft—to movement, to precision, to expression—and then seeing it culminate in a moment like that. The jumps, the edges, the choreography, the emotion. It's sport, but it's also art. It's years of invisible work condensed into four minutes on ice.

There's just something so beautiful about that.

Sports and stories and the dedication of a life to a talent—to movement, to physical ability—it does something to me. It reminds me what I'm drawn to. The expression of human nature through movement. The body pushed to its edge. The grace and the violence and the control all at once. I love that.

I need to remember that this is what moves me.

Not just code shipped or videos edited or software debated over—but the deeper thing. The human thing. The pursuit of mastery. The visible proof of discipline. The art inside the effort.

Maybe that's why the workouts feel so good lately. Why the consistency matters. Why watching someone like Alysa Liu skate hits deeper than just "cool, she won." It's the embodiment of years of showing up. Of refining. Of failing and coming back.

Wake up early.
Train hard.
Ship something.
Tighten it.
Repeat.

Even on rainy days.
