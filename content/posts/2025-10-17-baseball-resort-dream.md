Life's been pretty good lately, though I've spent a lot of time indoors because of my knee injury. I went to Fleet Week, hung out with friends, but otherwise I've been a bit of a hermit. Maybe that's just how weekdays go sometimes — quiet, focused, routine. I probably should get outside more, live a little more, but honestly, I've been enjoying just being on my computer, learning and building.

Right now, my curiosity is all in the digital world. I'm not super drawn to the outside world at the moment — even though I love nature, hiking, and socializing — my energy feels locked in on creating things. Still, one idea that keeps sparking something in me is this dream of building a physical place — a baseball resort, something like Rocker B Ranch in Texas, but in Hawaii.

I came across an ad recently for a baseball facility for sale in San Jose — just a small batting cage business — and it immediately grabbed my attention. Then I started reading about Rocker B Ranch: a 350-acre property in Texas that a family turned into a destination. They started with a tennis court, then built a few Airbnb-style houses, and eventually added a baseball field. Now, it's a full-fledged baseball complex hosting over 30 tournaments a year. Families stay onsite, barbecue, swim, hang out, and play baseball all weekend. It's basically baseball heaven.

I can't stop thinking about how incredible it would be to create something like that in Hawaii. Maybe a plot of land on the North Shore — plenty of space, surrounded by nature. I don't know if it's financially feasible yet, but if I can raise the capital someday, I know families would love it. Imagine flying out for a weekend of baseball and family time — vacation meets competition. It would help the local community, attract tourism, and celebrate the game in a beautiful, meaningful way.

That's a 20- or 30-year dream for me. If I can pull it off, I'll know I've made it — financially, personally, spiritually. I'd be building something real, something for my kids and for the next generation of players. It combines all my passions: baseball, family, and nature. It just feels right.
