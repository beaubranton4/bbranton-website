And just like that, it's Christmas. There are gifts exchanges last night. I got a coupe pillow, full body size, which I'm extremely stoked about. Having I slept on the same pillow last night. That's how long it is. And it's pretty damn comfy. I might have to get more coupe pillows. I love products that actually delight you when you get them and you use them. You know immediately that you are getting what you pay for. And it on one's hand sucks that. High prices can be justified, but at the same time it goes to show the power of good craftsmanship and a good product.

I woke up this morning and read a thought-provoking essay about what makes an agentic system successful (https://x.com/JayaGup10/status/2003525933534179480?s=20). The essay argues that the most successful agentic systems and software are not just systems of record, but also those that track what they call context graphs, or what might be described as tribal knowledge. For example, in Salesforce, when you log an opportunity, you're mostly logging the final state—even for something like a quote, it's just the values inputted by the rep and saved. It doesn't capture the context or reasoning for each value: "We went with $100,000 ARR because last year was $50,000 ARR and they went 2.5x over usage, so we met in the middle at 2x and gave a discount on that extra 0.5 as a goodwill gesture," etc. Salesforce doesn’t retain that chain of thought, but in an agentic world where agents are filling out these quotes, all that information is extremely valuable.

It's why I believe claude code and cursor are and will be super successful businesses and super successful products. It's because they have record of these context graphs and they have the chain of reasoning thoughts stored in memory. When you ask claude code - build me this button it will think and I'll say okay well I'm going with this color button because it matches your site theme and the rest of the page is already using the primary color so let's use your secondary color and so that gets stored memory and can be pulled up and referenced later down the line so right in the old version which is GitHub all you can see is well you chose a green button but in cloud code you have the entire chain of reasoning as to why the button was chosen to be green.

I've had this thought that it will actually be very hard to compete with incumbent software companies because AI agents at the end of the day will use software. So in my mind, it doesn't seem to technically impossible to layer on AI and agentic capabilities on top of existing software solutions. We can see proof of this in how easily companies have created and adopted MCP servers, Stripe, SuperBase, Canva. There are definitely some technical learning curves, but all of these software systems were architected in whatever you call it, Web 2.0. In that world, there was no such thing as agentic capabilities, but the ability to create tool calling, basically wrapping your functions in an API and calling it via a tool, being able to use those traditional legacy software functions via LLM is a huge unlock already. And it doesn't need, you don't need to rebuild from the ground up, which is why I think it's difficult. But this essay is saying that if you can design the entire product with this sort of, with these sort of context graphs in mind, those will be ultra successful.

So I'm trying to think of an example where I maybe Stripe, it's a great system of record. They help you process payments you embedded into your website and agentic coding agents make that super easy. Now, the one thing that Stripe doesn't have is when we get into an agentic world and all of these payments are just being processed automatically and different agents are integrating Stripe and making decisions with Stripe. The one thing it doesn't necessarily have is the context of, okay, well, this is a great idea. This user got a refund because X, Y and Z and if X, Y and Z happens, we should process a refund. Stripe doesn't have that context graph. It doesn't have the context into how we arrived at that state so that the agent can make a really good decision and replicate that.

These are half baked thoughts but I think important as we look forward into what agentic systems look like at the enterprise level and what the future of AI agents x software look like.

That does lead me to question. If i've built Dugout Edge, this website and any future projects with Claude Code or Cursor, is that contextual tribal knowledge being saved? Where? Can it be referenced? How can that be leveraged? If i had a conversation about a customer that had a failed payment and it built a corrected sequence of responses, will it be able to catch that the next time?

5 Ideas:

1) Mass produce cricut templates on etsy
2) systems > goals
