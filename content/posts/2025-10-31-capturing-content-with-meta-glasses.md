I've been really interested in capturing content through my Meta glasses recently. Just got them a couple of days ago. Still probably plan to return them, but I'm having a lot of fun just wearing them around, clicking the button, automatically creating content without having to think about the content that I'm creating or what I'm filming.

I'm really fascinated right now with the idea of running this thing on autopilot, just turning it on as I go throughout my daily life, capturing my day-to-day. And then overlaying my voice with maybe some of these daily journal entriesâ€”just some thoughts of the day, talk about what I'm working on. And then just kind of showing my work and documenting my thought process daily, supplemented with video clips from that day.

It doesn't have to be long, just like a few minutes of video. That's literally just clicking the button on the glasses a few times and wearing it. And then automating the process of posting that onto my blog, automating the process of posting that on TikTok.

Obviously, I just created a video of me cooking. It took about maybe an hour to make it look good. So if I get better, maybe I can cut that down, but it would be great if I could just automate that all.

Anyways, here's the first take at creating a video on my Meta glasses, editing it in CapCut, and then sharing with the world with my voice thoughts in overlay.
