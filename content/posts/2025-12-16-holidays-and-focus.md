Man, do I love the holidays.

Decorations everywhere. Delicious desserts. Everybody just feels happier. People at the grocery store telling you "happy holidays" like they actually mean it. And best of all, no one seems to be working. It's kind of this unspoken agreement between coworkers that the week of Christmas? Nobody's working. The week before? Probably not either. And by default, the week after is a wash too. The bookends themselves.

And yet—this is exactly the time to lock in.

This is when I should be focusing on my entrepreneurial pursuits. Locking in on Dugout Edge. Or at least locking in on learning whatever it is I need to learn next. I know I need to be getting better at marketing. Learning how to sell. Learning how to play the social media game. Right now I'm playing the Google game, the SEO game, and I do think it's a valuable game to learn. But if I'm being honest, I'm not learning that much—I'm mostly just playing it. Picking things up by osmosis, by default.

There aren't many "tricks" living in my head that couldn't just be found in an LLM. That's not a great place to be. It means I'm not really internalizing frameworks or building intuition—just executing.

So I really need to decide what I want to focus on. If that's Dugout Edge, so be it. Make that the primary focus and stop pretending I can juggle everything at once. I can already tell how fragile my focus is. Just today, with Christmas shopping on my mind, dealing with the plumber, and handling a very small work task, I managed to create enough decision paralysis that I didn't spend a single minute between 9 and 5 working on Dugout Edge. Or on the stipend migration. Which is honestly a damn shame.

But it's also revealing. Multitasking is mostly a lie. We can realistically have one, maybe two, possibly three priorities at any given time—and that's it.

I think of it as the Tommy Edman parable. Back in college, he told me you can only focus on two out of three things: your social life, baseball, and academics. Pick two. It's incredibly hard to do all three well. The funny thing is, he actually did all three well—but for the average human being, it's basically impossible. I'm definitely not the exception.

One of the highlights today was working with the plumber. I'm still amazed that he charged $375 to install a gas shutoff valve. All it really involved was adding one additional pipe onto an already existing pipe. An extremely easy job. But because it involves gas—and people are scared of gas—and because we're in San Francisco, he's able to charge an arm and a leg for it.

All he did was screw it on, add an adapter so the hose from my gas range would be compatible, and test it for leaks. He didn't even have to turn off the gas in the building. Still, it really makes you think about how valuable trade skills are—and how they're not getting replaced by AI anytime soon. Fear, regulation, and specialization create real pricing power.

It's probably a little early to be making some grand list of life rules, but it keeps coming back to the same themes. I need to learn how to sell. I need to learn social media. And honestly, I just need to get out into the world more. I need to adventure a bit. See how the story unfolds.

Because if I just sit in my house all the time, that is the story. A story about what I saw on my phone. What I scrolled past. What I crawled through on the internet. And I don't think that's a great way to live.

At the same time, being home is what gives me the space to build. To write code. To create things in the cloud. To actually ship projects. There's a real tension there.

So for now, the answer isn't obvious. All I can really do is keep thinking about it. Keep turning it over. Keep narrowing the focus until something clicks.

And maybe that's enough—for today.
