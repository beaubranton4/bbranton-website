excerpt: 'Reflections on what energizes me, taking the path of least resistance, and skills I want to develop.'

The more I reflect on what I'm interested in and what I actually like doing, the clearer it becomes: I enjoy building things from zero to one. I like getting projects off the ground, which explains why I start so many and often don't completely finish them. The excitement for me is in the creation, in that initial phase where something comes to life.

Because of that, I think the best kind of project for me would be one that combines that zero-to-one energy with automation. Something I can build, set up, and then let run on its own while I benefit from it. A few examples come to mind: a stock trading algorithm that requires minimal oversight once built, a social media channel that's fully automated, or even a content system that produces blog posts without my constant input. Those ideas feel fun and aligned with what energizes me.

Beyond automation, there are other things that call to me. Writing an autobiography sounds exciting. I also like the idea of starting a gym or a social club—a place where people can go to hang out, play games, and play sports. I miss that sense of community from college, where you'd live around a bunch of people, eat together, and constantly have opportunities to socialize. Even if you didn't know everyone, you were part of something bigger, and that made it easy to meet people and form connections. I think that's something most adults lose as they get older, and it feels like a missing piece in life.

Another reflection I've had about myself is that I often take the path of least resistance. Sometimes that works in my favor, and sometimes it doesn't. On the negative side, it can look like taking shortcuts—skipping over important details that later come back to haunt me. But on the positive side, it often allows me to achieve a goal quickly. I'm able to cut out the fluff and unnecessary steps because I tend to go straight at the problem, drilling through the mountain instead of wandering around it or trying to climb over it. That approach lets me reach the end faster, but it also means I have to be mindful of situations where more due diligence is needed. The key is recognizing it as a potential flaw, guarding against it when necessary, and forcing myself to slow down when details truly matter.

There are also a few skills I know I need to work on. First, I want to learn to speak continuously and more effectively. I want to become more well-spoken. Speaking is an art, and like any art, it can be practiced and learned. Doing daily journal entries like this feels like a good step toward sharpening those skills.

Second, I need to learn to sell better. Selling is also an art—and one of the most valuable skills a person can have. Along with that, I want to learn to play the social media game. If I can figure out how to create content, make videos, and really grab people's attention, I think that would be an incredibly powerful skill in today's world.

If I can combine those—learning to sell, mastering social media, improving my speaking, and building things—I know I'll have a strong foundation. With my current skill set and the drive to keep learning, I feel confident I'll be able to figure things out.
