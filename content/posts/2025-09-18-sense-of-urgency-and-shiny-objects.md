Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about urgency—and how often I let Shiny Object Syndrome get in the way. It’s just another form of procrastination, disguised as productivity.

**This morning:**  
I went out to Paul Goode Field, where University High plays their baseball games. I was running sprints to get ready for my soccer league, just trying not to get hurt—because at this point, I really do feel like an old man.

While I was out there, I saw this kid. Definitely in high school, absolute stud. I could tell instantly—he had that natural explosiveness, quick-twitch muscles everywhere. His dribbling, his ball control, the way he worked against the wall—it was all max effort, sharp, impressive.

It reminded me so much of when I used to train for baseball. That feeling of being out there alone, no distractions, giving 100% to perfecting my craft. The grind, the repetition, the sharpening of skills for an outcome that mattered. I miss that. I miss pouring myself fully into something, body and soul, chasing growth.

There aren’t many places in life outside of sports and art where you can do that. Maybe I just haven’t found my next version of it yet. But I know I’m craving something like that—something I can give everything to.

**Meanwhile, my head is spinning with ideas.**  
It feels like I *definitely* have Shiny Object Syndrome:

- I want to start a hat business.
- I want to start an Aloha shirt brand.
- I want to build a SaaS company.
- I want to open an indoor gym where athletes can hang out and push themselves.
- I want to start a sports league.
- A social media channel.
- A fitness channel.
- A blog where I run outside and document workouts without a gym.

There are so many things I want to do—and I want to try them all. But I can’t. I don’t have the time, and honestly, even with AI tools, I don’t have the focus to do all of them well.

I know I need to niche down. To pick one or two things and go all in.  
But I also believe curiosity is a compass. Following what excites me has always led me to interesting places. Like Dugout Edge—born out of me just wanting to play softball. That curiosity turned into a project with real traction.

So I’m caught between these two forces: the need for focus, and the pull of curiosity. Both matter. Both feel true. The trick is learning when to follow curiosity and when to anchor down.

And then it all ties back to time.

The truth is, nobody really has that much time when you zoom out and think about life in the big picture. But for me, right now more than ever feels like the time to take a risk. To step into the unknown, to bet on myself.

Financially, this is probably the least risky time I’ll ever have. I’m getting married in a year and a half, and kids will probably follow soon after. Once that phase of life begins, my ability to go all in will shrink. So if there’s ever a moment to commit, it’s now.

The timing in the broader world feels right, too. I don’t think “vibe coding” is at the point where anyone can just build a product overnight, but I have the skills—the bare minimum, the basics—to make something real. And more importantly, I’ve already proven to myself that I can build something people will pay for. That’s huge. It means the leap isn’t from zero; it’s from a solid starting point.

So yeah—I think the move is to double down on Dugout Edge.  
To commit.  
To stop splitting my focus across ten different ideas and instead make this the thing.

My project. My business. My source of income.  
The place where I put in the grind, the reps, the discipline.  
My new version of perfecting a craft.
