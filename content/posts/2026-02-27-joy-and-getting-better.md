excerpt: "Woke up with overwhelming joy stepping outside for a run—good life, beautiful partner and friends, low stress. Also woke with an urge to get better. 15–20 lbs to shed, lock in on body and goals. A man needs two pursuits: physical and intellectual. Dugout Edge and workouts. Body not where it needs to be despite working out hard—diet or routine or both. Need structure: same things each day/week, increase weight and intensity. MyFitnessPal, 10k steps, eat less, more HIIT and muscle-building. Less sedentary."

I woke up this morning and stepped outside for a run and immediately felt an overwhelming sense of joy. The sun was shining in my face, and I couldn't knock the feeling that I was just happy. I have such a good life—a home to live in, a beautiful partner, beautiful friends, in a beautiful city with a wonderful life, low stress, low turmoil.

I also woke up this morning with an overwhelming sense to get better. This was before I stepped outside. I woke up, looked at my phone for maybe 20 seconds, realized that it wouldn't do me any good, opened up the windows, stared outside, stretched a little bit, and looked at my body. I've developed a little bit of a stomach in the last year or so, and I'm looking forward to shedding that. It's about 15–20 pounds of fat, and I'll be in the best shape of my life. It's not easy. It'll be hard. I'm looking forward to doing it. I still obviously want to have fun, but this is the year I think I lock in on my body. I lock in on my goals and I attack them with discipline and focus.

That's all I think a man really needs in life—two pursuits. I think he needs a physical pursuit and an intellectual pursuit. I think I'm finding those in Dugout Edge and in my workout routine.

I think what's crazy to me is that I work out nearly every day, consistently, pretty hard. I'd say I work out really well—yet my body still isn't where it needs to be. And so I obviously need to change something. And that needs to be either my diet or my workout routine or it's both. I keep saying this. I feel like I need to stick to a structured routine where I continually do the same things each day, each week, but just increase the weights, increase the intensity. Because right now I'm just kind of winging it in the gym. And I think I need a more structured plan. Same for eating and dieting. MyFitnessPal is good for tracking and I think that's working, but I think that my workouts are lazy. My body—my metabolism isn't as fast as it used to be. I'm not moving as much. I'm definitely way more sedentary. I think that's probably it—I don't have these physical activities that I used to do all the time, getting outside, walking around. I'm just stuck at home all day. So in order to negate those effects I think maybe I need: 10k steps a day, eat a little bit less, and when I work out I think I need a more structured routine, do a little bit more high-intensity athletic movements that build muscle and shred fat.
