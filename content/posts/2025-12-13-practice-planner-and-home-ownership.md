I've been working hard on the public version of the practice planner for Dugout Edge. I've been doing research on practice planning/scheduling software and I feel pretty good that I'm building the absolute best and user friendly software out there. And I'm planning to make it free (with some gated features). I'm really excited about getting this thing launched. The only thing is that I don't think it will be as good of a lead magnet as the lineup generator. It is getting clicks, but maybe about 10% as many as the generator. Maybe when the page is actually helpful and i can mass produce plans using my own tool it will start ranking. We'll see, but it's a safe bet and will benefit my users.

I've also spent quite a lot of time on replacing this Thermador gas range and oven. Before we left to Switzerland, the oven stopped working. We got quoted $1500 to fix it, so I decided to buy a new one. Had to do research, go shopping, and decide on one. Then I tried selling the other one - found a cool and interesting guy Bob who is willing to buy it and haul it away for $250. Seems like a win win for both. Yesterday, the costco delivery and installation team came. Turns out, the kitchen doesn't have a local gas shutoff valve. Now I have to hire a plumber to install a gas shutoff valve (another $375). Funny enough, Bob volunteered to do it for free. He said it was a simple job. But at the end of the day, when it comes to gas I really don't want to take any chances so will go with a pro.

Anyways, maybe just venting here, but home ownership is no joke. These are the hidden costs. This entire thing will cost me about $2300 and I've had to spend about 10 hours and a lot of mental capacity. I think i've made all the right decisions along the way, but it's time, money and sleep i don't get back.

Overall, not bad. Have a nice full Saturday ahead of me. Going to go for a run, cook a nice big breakfast, work on Dugout Edge, migrate Spend my Stipend off of wordpress, and see how much time i have. Then I'm gonna hang with the boys and do secret santa tonight.
