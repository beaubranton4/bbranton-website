I skipped journaling yesterday. My plan had been to switch things up—write at night instead of in the morning—so I could recap the day: the events, thoughts, and progress I made. I wanted to split each entry into two parts. First, a free-flowing section for daily reflections, the random thoughts and ideas that drift through my mind. Second, a "show your work" segment—what I actually did that day to move closer to my goals, whether in entrepreneurship, self-improvement, or fitness.

But that plan got derailed when I injured my knee playing soccer in the Volo league. It was bad enough that, in the moment, I was almost sure I tore my ACL. I definitely heard (or maybe felt) something—a pop, a rip, something you never want to feel. I'd been sprinting to save a ball from going out of bounds, tried to stop suddenly or twist, and then it happened. I hobbled off right away and couldn't keep playing.

After sitting down for about five minutes, though, the pain started to ease up. I could walk again—gingerly, but still—so I went back out and played goalie. That felt like a good sign. The pain was manageable, mostly just uncomfortable. But there were two specific movements that triggered sharp pain: once when I tried to kick a ball, and again when I planted and threw. Both times, my knee just kind of gave out. Probably not the smartest thing to keep testing it, but I needed to know what I was dealing with.

I was still able to walk to the car, limp home, and move under my own power. So, all things considered, those are positives. Still, I can't shake the worry that it might be something more serious. The knee is such a complex joint—you never really know until you get it imaged. It could be a simple sprain, or something worse that only shows up when cutting or pivoting. I'm honestly a little scared to get out of bed right now, just in case it feels worse. But I think I need to message my PCP and get it checked soon. I just really don't want to deal with the hassle or the cost—and maybe, deep down, I'm a little afraid of what the MRI might show. For now, I'll take it day by day, rest, ice, and hope it's just a tweak.

On a more productive note, yesterday I made a lot of progress on my site. I built out more visual content for posts, added video URLs, and the drill library is almost ready to go live. Honestly, I could publish it today—I just need to update a few database values and add some additional drills. That's my main goal for the day: get it live. I've been putting it off long enough.

I also started building out my email automation system—templates for different user scenarios, depending on where they are in their journey. I wrote a few drafts already: one for users who are about to churn, another for users who started a free trial but never set up their team, and one for those whose free trial is about to end. The next step is writing an email for users who signed up but never started a trial at all.

That group is tricky—the most likely reason is they didn't want to enter their credit card info, hoping the product was completely free. I might experiment with offering them a free month to see if that brings them back.

Even though my user base is still small, I think it's worth setting up this email flow now. It'll matter more as things grow. I want to build analytics around it too—tracking who got which email, whether they converted, and what the success rates are. Basically, I want to measure if the email accomplished its goal.

So today's focus: rest the knee, publish the drill library, and keep working on automations. Take it easy, but still move things forward.
