excerpt: "Broke the chain of good habits again. Bike ride, Stanford baseball, groceries, laundry. Dugout Edge: ~2 paying subs/day lately. Crossroads—new product, go ham on marketing, or scrap it? Could this replace my job? Can baseball be my life's work? Sitting with it."

Another weekend, another few days of breaking my chain of good habits. Went for a nice bike ride today and rotted on the couch watching Stanford baseball. Got some groceries and did laundry. Now kind of wasting time just brainstorming about what to do to market Dugout Edge a bit more. I really feel like I'm getting to the point where I need to either build a whole new product offering, just go ham on marketing to see how big this can get during season, or scrap it and start working on something new. I can't decide.

The traction is actually good—I've been getting on average two new paying subscribers a day for the last week or so, which is awesome. It's been about six months since I launched. I've made $1,200 and have about 40 paying subscribers. Hoping to get to 100 by the middle of April. So part of me thinks: keep going. But I keep circling the same questions. Could this project actually replace my job one day? Can I really keep building in the baseball space and make it my life's work? Or am I just spinning my wheels in a niche that'll never get big enough? I don't have the answer. Just sitting with it.
