It’s interesting - I feel like I have momentum on Dugout Edge. I’ve started getting customers, I’m gaining traction, and yet I’m actually losing a little bit of motivation. I don’t know if it’s just the day and i'm tired, or something deeper, but I feel kind of stuck on where to go next. Maybe I’m afraid to break things. Maybe it’s fear of failure. Either way, I’ve been procrastinating on the important updates I need to make to grow the site.

I’ve been putting in three or four hours today, but I don’t feel like I’m making substantial moves. I know the things I need to do to push the needle—get more visitors, implement new features, market more—but I can’t seem to get myself to do them right now. And maybe that’s okay. Maybe I just build up some users, then step away until next week when I get back from Las Vegas. We’ll see.

Work calls today were standard. We discussed a new pricing plan we’re rolling out and how to strategize reporting and communication with operations teams. It’s tricky—we don’t want to show data in a way that misrepresents how customers view the platform, especially with multiple plans now. I also had a call with our VP of FP&A and our Director of Pricing. They’re great people, very sharp, and the meetings were solid.

Still, I can’t help but feel like I’ll never be like that—commanding a room, talking with ease, navigating those corporate conversations with confidence. Those are the skills that matter in that world, and I don’t think it’s a game I want to play—or one I can win. That’s why entrepreneurship feels more appealing. In that world, it’s not about commanding a room; it’s about the quality of decisions you make. That’s the game I want to play.

I really think I could be a solo entrepreneur. Sure, it’s hard and maybe more fun with friends, but I’ve built enough now—Dugout Edge, data pipelines, a trading bot, StartupSeeds.io—that I feel the confidence to take the plunge. It’s funny: the biggest thing I’ve gained isn’t the skills or the projects themselves, it’s the confidence to believe I can do something bigger and better.

At the same time, I keep wondering: is this really what I want? Is building software and tools what I love to do? Or would I be better off doing something completely different—like filming comedy content, or creating a channel around something adventurous, like biking across the U.S. from California to New York?

These are the kinds of thoughts running through my head today.
