so basically i've just done a bunch of keyword research about topics that i'm interested in. I've been keeping notes pad about
business ideas i want to start. i looked all of them up. and did analysis on keyword volume, difficulty, and cpc. 
The goal was to find highish cpc (indicating high purchase intent) with low difficulty, high volume (it won't be that high. 1,000 would be very high end but 100+ is enough to get started).
You need a foothold in the market. You need to be able to get started with a small amount of traffic and grow from there.

I then looked up "near me" which is what people have defaulted to when they're looking for something geographically close ( i assume a byproduct of google's algorithm). A few things stood out to me:

I removed anything higher than 25% KD difficulty.

This gave me the highest keyword arbitrage opportunities. If i could rank organically and drive traffic I could make signigifcant amount of money in lead generation.

Highest CPC's on the internet are for "XX Accident Attorney Near Me".
Then came accident and emergency services.

What I learned is that these are such high intent (customer is ready to purchase) queries that the CPC gets driven exorbitantly high. it is nearly impossible to rank organically in these niches. they may look promising, but high CPC means it is not something google will easily promote either. Between 1-8 is a sweet spot.

In No particular order:

1. Funny cards e-commerce store
2. Workout Hats
3. lymphatic massage directory site (https://booksy.com/)
4. Cooler Rental


Additional Ideas:

5. Financing For Emergency Services (10% lift in volume. You get paid. That's it. We deal with the customer)
6. Use Go High Level and build CRM's/Scheduling Software for people in specific niches like baseball batting cage rentals.
