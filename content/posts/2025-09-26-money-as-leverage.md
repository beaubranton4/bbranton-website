excerpt: "Reflections on changing my mindset about money and seeing it as a tool for growth rather than something to hold onto."

I'm still down at the in-laws place. Had a great workout today with Abby's dad, and honestly, I'm just blown away by how strong he is at his age. For the most part, he lifts more than me—definitely benches more, shoulder presses more. He's probably twice my age, yet stronger in so many ways. I hope that when I reach his age, I'm even half as strong as he is.

We had some really good conversations last night and today about business, career, and Dugout Edge. One of the biggest realizations I had, thanks to him, is that I might be too limited in my mindset about money. I've always been very frugal, and while that has its benefits, I think it also holds me back.

What I need to embrace more is the idea that money is leverage. I tend to think that if I'm losing money in the short term, it's a bad decision or too risky. But the reality is that great entrepreneurs are comfortable with risk—as long as it's educated risk. They're willing to spend and even lose money in the short run if it means growth in the long run.

Looking back at my businesses so far, I've mostly put in time without spending much capital, which means I've only seen small returns. To grow, I need to start thinking about how to use money as a tool to generate more revenue.

And it's not always about direct ROI in dollars. There are other forms of return. For example, say I open a gym and make a million dollars, but it costs me a million to run. Profit-wise, I'm at zero. The old me would look at that and think it's a terrible outcome. But maybe it isn't. Because what I'd actually have is a gym that provides value to a community, a space where I can meet people, and a place for me to work out. Those are real returns, even if they aren't purely financial.

Of course, if that's my only source of income, I'd want it to be profitable. But not every dollar spent needs to immediately generate profit. There are intangible benefits—relationships, experiences, brand building, community value—that matter just as much, if not more in some cases.

I need to internalize this way of thinking and stop seeing money purely as something to hold on to. It's a tool, a form of leverage, and using it the right way could change the trajectory of my businesses and my life.
