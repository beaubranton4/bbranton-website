I’m going camping this weekend in Bodega Bay with Lucana, Thomas, Alana, and Abby. I’m really excited — it’ll be so nice to disconnect, get out in nature, and spend time with friends.

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about simplicity. The simpler, the better — especially when it comes to priorities and goals. There are always so many things to focus on, and it’s easy to get lost in the noise. If I look at my to-do list for Dugout Edge, there are easily 50 things I could be working on. The real challenge is ruthless prioritization — cutting through the clutter and focusing on the few things that actually matter.

For me, right now, that focus is health — both physical and mental. If I had to boil my entire life down to one priority, that’s it. Eating healthy, reducing visceral fat, and taking care of my body are all connected. It’ll ease the pain in my back and hips, clear my mind, and give me more energy. It’s all intertwined.

That also means avoiding the stuff that drags me down — the short-term dopamine hits that ultimately make me feel worse. Things like edibles, alcohol, or nicotine might give a quick boost, but they drain me over time. If I can stay away from those, I know I’ll be sharper, more motivated, and naturally more in tune with what I actually care about.

It’s kind of funny, but the phrase that keeps coming to mind is that I just need to raw-dog life — no filters, no artificial hits of dopamine. Get my satisfaction from progress, discipline, and long-term wins instead of the short bursts.

I’m still thinking about what to try next project-wise, but I’m realizing the best move might just be to stop overthinking and start experimenting. We live in a time where I can test dozens of ideas quickly with AI — so why not do that? Plant 15 seeds, see which ones grow the fastest, and nurture those. The key is motion — just doing, learning, and adjusting as I go.
