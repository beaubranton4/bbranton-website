excerpt: "Welcoming a new family member and reflecting on life's milestones."

Today, my little nephew Noah was born. Early this morning, Dani had a C-section, with Abby, her mom, and Tim all in the room. I wasn't there in person—still at home for now—but I'll go meet them later today. It's an incredibly joyous moment for everyone. The Moonies, the Cruzes, me… the whole family is obviously in a great mood. Everyone's healthy, happy, and doing well.

There was a little scare at first—when Noah came out, he wasn't breathing. I can only imagine how terrifying that was for everyone in the room. But in the end, it all worked out. He's here, safe, and the relief and gratitude in that moment must have been overwhelming.

It's interesting to try to internalize these kinds of milestone moments. It's not directly my milestone, but it is for someone very close to me who's the same age as I am. Dani and Tim are both my age, and it makes me think about where I am in life. I've been reflecting on that a lot recently, and this just stamps itself onto my mind as another reminder.

In some ways, I think that's what we're all here to do—carry forward the circle of life, recreate, reproduce, and extend both our bloodline and the human race. Not everyone would frame it that way, but it resonates with me. At the same time, it sharpens my focus on the fact that this is my life. I only get one, and it moves fast. If I want something, I have to grab it by the horns and hold on, because you never know when it ends. You never know when you'll become bedridden, or when opportunities will stop coming.

I think of it like baseball. If life is one game, you only get a few at bats. Maybe five, maybe six. And even then, you might only see one or two good pitches worth swinging at. So you have to go up there ready, swinging. They don't all have to be home runs—take the singles, get on base, keep moving forward.

Moments like this also remind me how important health is. My future sister-in-law has had her share of health problems, which made people nervous during the pregnancy and led to her being induced early. That only reinforces for me how critical it is to take care of my body now, to make sure that when it's my turn, I'm in the right place physically and mentally.

On a separate note, I really feel strongly that I need to start practicing and working on creating content for social media. I need to learn how to go viral. Whether it's building a personal brand, marketing a product, or simply entertaining people, I feel like that skill is the unlock. If I know how to consistently capture attention online, I'll be successful no matter what direction I go. From there, it's almost impossible to fail.
