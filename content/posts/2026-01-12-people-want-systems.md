People want systems. I own systems.

2nd Brain

Coding While I sleep

social media - storytelling

create a league centered around attention and fun and sport.

The story of the day was golf with old friends. Laughing on the course and sharing a delicious meal. Jake's first time trying Sisig. My first time having sisig drowned in mayo. All from the craziest named restaurant in the world. SW8 DaDa's Sizzling Sisig.

Today I caught myself thinking about what it would be like to work for one of the greatest companies in today's world. A behemoth. Something that was undisputedly one of the most desirable companies to work at, such as an OpenAI, or a Google, or an Anthropic. I'm not sure that I would love this, but at the same time I do kind of miss the sense of belonging, a way to meet people, a way to have this inbuilt community, where I can meet new people, have new experiences, and be in person. Part of me is desiring that, but a huge part of me still wants to be the solider canoeer, toiling away, managing AI agents and systems like a puppet master.

I'm really going to have to push over the next couple of days to get the premium version of the practice planner on the door. Luckily work hasn't been too stressful and it doesn't seem like I'm going to have that much to do while I'm here at the home of Hawaii.

I've been listening a lot to the Moth Podcasts and thinking about what sorts of stories I could tell. I do really feel inclined to write down my best stories on paper. I do think that I'm a good writer. I do think I'm a good storyteller. I think orally and off the cuff I'm not. But when given pen and paper and time, I think that I can riff with the best of them.
