Skipped journaling again yesterday. But yesterday was a good day. Saw Book of Mormon. Had a good workout with Abby. Looking forward to getting after it in the gym and working on physical fitness the year leading up to our wedding. Got about one year and four days. 369 days until our wedding. And we're trying to be in the best shape of our lives.

I woke up this morning with a few thoughts in my head, the first was that I should be doing what gives me joy. What brings me emotion? I get these overwhelming feelings of emotion after shows, after performances. Beautiful sports stories. I think at heart, that's what I truly love. Performance. And I include sports in the overall category of performances. Athletes. Elite athletes are at the end of the day elite entertainers. If you think about it, it's a very similar process working on your craft. Drilling yourself with repetition after repetition, to perfect a certain movement, a certain motion, a certain action that produces a certain outcome. And it's very much the same with acting, with singing, with dancing. You're not always sure that the audience is going to like it and you're not always sure that you're going to get the result that you're going to get. Is the right one, but you can control what you can't control, which is your own self. How you respond, how you act. The only real difference with sport is that it's a lot more dependent on other players that are playing with you in the game, but in many ways that could be said about acting on a stage with other actors or performing in a band with other band members.

I'm also pretty certain that I'd like to maybe try and start a baseball team. There's a men's ball, sorry men's league hardball league. I don't know men's hardball league is the right way to say it. I think I'd like to try and do that. I miss having a group of people that I do something with every week. Especially something that's good for me, healthy, gets me outside, gets me moving. I'm pretty fascinated with this idea of practice, forming leagues just to practice sports. Or maybe even outside of ball leagues that you go and practice a couple of times a week and you play games. Real leagues, just like we had when we were kids. The idea of that is really appealing to me and is something that I think would benefit a lot of people. I just don't know if people have the time and effort, especially here in San Francisco where people just work, work, work.
