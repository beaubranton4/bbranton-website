Friday nights are typically nights of gluttony. Last night was no different. We had a nice dinner at Pinsa Rossa, had Salt & Straw, had popcorn, kakimochi and our li hing snacks from Hawaii. Today we're going to the Red Bull F1 show event in the Marina. Should be a good time.

I've been getting a lot of signups on Dugout Edge—probably averaging one a day for the last couple of weeks—which is awesome. I might actually get to 100 subscribers, which is my goal for this year. The key will be retaining them, figuring out how to scale 10x beyond that, maybe introducing new forms of revenue. Because I don't know how feasible it is to actually get to a thousand. You know, my maybe one-year, two-year goal would be to get to a thousand subscribers. In one year that would be the ultimate goal, because that would mean that I could probably survive off the income. To really entertain that I think it would take more like 2000.

In any case, I finally got Remotion working to create a semi-decent demo video. It's still a 6/10 right now. I think I can get it to an 8/10. Might not be super useful, but good for branding and a good skill to learn and have in the back pocket.
