The date is November 17th, 2025. Another rainy day in San Francisco. Time has been moving really, really fast for me. It seems like just yesterday I turned 30. They say that as you age, time moves faster because each day of your life is a smaller fraction of your entire life. When you're one year old, one day is one divided by 365 days of your life. When you're at 30, one day has only been one divided by 365 times 30. So it's such a small portion of your life — that's why they say it moves faster, I guess.

You're also not experiencing new things as often, is what I hear. I'm no expert on this, but I do believe that as your brain makes new experiences, it's able to draw a timeline and associate those memories across the x-axis of time, which then therefore tricks your brain into thinking things are moving slower, more is happening. If every day is exactly the same, it doesn't really feel like anything's happened at all, but time has just passed.

Anyways, I think what I'm trying to get at is that I don't want time to just pass me by. I want to experience new experiences, experience life. And I have been having fun with friends. But part of me thinks that there's more that I can be experiencing. Don't get me wrong. I'm fully satisfied with where I'm at and what I've done, but that's just me. It's my nature to want to experience more and to want better for myself. It's one of my best defining qualities. And it has allowed me to succeed even in times where I've been extremely lazy or make bad decisions because we're all continuously learning, we're all continuously developing.

My hip is bothering me again after that run with Abby on Saturday. I really think it's due to the issues with my knee. I think it's changing the biomechanics of how I run. I'm putting more pressure on my right hip causing that pain. So, yeah, definitely something just not quite right with my body. I need to get it back into shape.

I've been thinking a lot about how high stress workouts, like hip workouts, high intensity, lifting is great. But I think I need to do more low impact endurance movement. More light, steady movement where I'm not stressing my body as much. I'm not activating my immune system. I saw an interesting TikTok this weekend about how a lot of college athletes, former athletes, have kind of these pretty bad autoimmune diseases shortly after retiring. And I think there might be some sort of truth behind it. I don't know if it's backed by science or if it's backed by fact, but I think it makes sense.

I believe I have AS, ankylosing spondylitis. And that is basically when your immune system works in overdrive because it thinks that there's some sort of threat. So as a byproduct, it builds out kind of new bones actually in your spine and calcifies some of the gaps in your spine to connect the different vertebrae, I guess. And that just makes me think sometimes if you put your body under immense levels of stress, just like marathon runners, just like elite athletes, of course it makes you look good and you look strong, but that might not necessarily be good for your body either.

So prioritizing cardio, working on my heart fitness, obviously still working out lifting weights because it's good to be strong, but focusing more on my weaknesses, focusing on low impact movements and more just moving your body continuously instead of trying to go all out like sprints. I know it's good to save time, but maybe if I can just walk up and down my stairs or do a little stretching five minutes here and there, it doesn't always need to be one hour, go hard at the gym, go home and then sit for the next 23 hours. I just need to incorporate movement into my everyday lifestyle.

The last thing that I've been thinking about here, well, a couple of things. One is again mini apps and ChatGPT apps. I think that obviously the App Store is a huge platform already, but there's a new paradigm shift where the App Store is enabling the mini app ecosystem. So larger apps, for example, Spotify, they can use a mini app called a messaging platform and embed that directly into their app and the entire back end of the messaging system, all that I believe will be hosted by the developer of the mini app. I'm not sure exactly how it works, but that's my understanding. I need to do a little bit more research, but I think that this is truly a huge opportunity, especially in the ChatGPT world.

If people are going to be building apps, basically these are just going to be, instead of people going to the App Store and looking for an app that identifies plants. The new way people are going to look for these sorts of things is they're going to ask their AI agent, which is essentially ChatGPT, because I think ChatGPT is, you know, they're going to have a significant market share. So call it one billion people will be on ChatGPT's rails, using their models to query, whether that's through a voice agent or maybe it's through another sort of AI agent. But these things, all of these AI systems are going to be kind of connected through OpenAI and their models. And if their model is trained to call these different little mini apps or ChatGPT apps.

Going back to that flower example: if you have the ChatGPT app for identifying flowers, someone, you know, hundreds, thousands of people a day asks, upload a picture and say, hey, ChatGPT, what am I looking at with flowers? It pulls up your mini app and it gets brought up. It's just like instant distribution.

Now the question is, what is the monetization play with building those? Because, you know, obviously if you can beat the ChatGPT algorithm and your little mini ChatGPT app gets used, obviously it'll be like better than being ranked number one on Google. But the question is, how do you monetize? In the previous world of SEO, you could monetize through AdSense. I don't see that being a play here because these are just like the output is generally just going to be, well, I guess it could be within the ChatGPT interface, but I'm even thinking like, if this thing is just telling me what it is in the background, you know, maybe the ads come in the form of whatever you build out. So if you build like a little web application where they can view the flower, maybe it's like see other images of that flower, like have a little space for ads or if it's being spoken back to you, it's like, this is that flower, you can buy that flower at this shop, this shop, and this shop. So there potentially is the ad route. Maybe there's also, there's definitely the affiliate market route. Maybe there is a path to monetization there, but I don't think people are building that route out. So maybe that's something that I could focus on. It's like the new SEO is going to be in AI agents. So it's just interesting to think about.

In other case, last thing I want to mention: I really enjoy journaling, but I'm trying to figure out if, right, this whole process of meditation, journaling every morning that just took me about an hour. It's, you know, maybe a waste of time. Do you think that journaling has been beneficial for me just to practice speaking? I do think journaling is efficient for me because it keeps me on track, tells me what I want to do. It's 10 minutes practice gratitude, but yeah, I'm kind of debating whether or not it's saving me time or if it's ultimately hurting me.

Another thing to consider is like, I'm handwriting my journal right now. Not my journal — these journals I'm speaking through voice, but my to-do list journal is all being written by hand. And I'm wondering if it would save me time if I did it electronically, if I built this system where I could do it via voice. Or if it's actually better for me because I get to think about what I want to be very intentional about how I organize my day and how I plan my time. Yeah, something to think about. But maybe I'll build this voice system, this to-do list system and then I can compare. Because that's what you ultimately need to do. You need to try things, you need to test things, you need to do things. That's the best way to learn.

One interesting observation I had today is that when I eat sugar, I literally feel my immune system fighting back. I think sugar makes me sick, like literally sick.
