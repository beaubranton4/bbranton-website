excerpt: 'Am I wasting my time with recording my thoughts in a daily journal?'

I wonder often, if I'm using my time properly. After all, I am an optimizer.

Should I spend 15-20 minutes a day recording my thoughts in a journal? Should I be writing down my to-do list, or should I be typing? Or should I just simply be doing...

I've been working on multiple projects at once. Dugout Edge is still my primary concern, but I've also launched a new website called Cha2Go. My plan with Cha2Go is to collect data on asian tea brands - what people are interested in, what they buy, what they want. I've already learned a lot building the website and just researching other brands. There really is no innovation in the asian tea space, especially when it comes to bottled asian tea. 

The final goal will be to develop my own D2C asian tea brand. Once the site starts getting a little traction, i will start advertising my own teas as opposed to other brands' teas and then eventually only sell my own brands' teas.

A couple reasons why this excites me:

The no/low calorie drink movement. Not enough healthy drink options that are refreshing (and not sweetened by artificial sweetener).

There is almost zero competition in the asian american tea market. Every bottle has an asian language written on it.

Microplastics - everyone is afraid of that and the searches are exponential on google. IF we can build a brand centered around no micro plastic Asian American tea.

A chance to learn marketing and partner with a friend. 

It sounds fun.


ON the Dugout Edge side, slowly but surely making my way through the practice planner. If i thought vibe coding the lineup generator was hard, this is going to be harder.

Back to the early thoughts of this journal entry - is it a waste of time to be focusing on both? Should I choose one or the other? I think the answer is probably yes, if I want the highest chance of success. But maybe I want to build a portfolio of cash-flowing autopilot companies. So i need to get comfortable context switching.

Maybe Cha2Go is too big a swing. I realy like the concept of building these little one page tools that just solve a very very specific problem. A problem so painful that people may be willing to pay for it right then and there on the spot.
