I'm doing my laundry while I write — or rather, while I speak into my phone. I keep wondering what the neurological difference is between writing and speaking. Is my brain processing things differently depending on how I record my thoughts? Either way, I've been journaling for almost a month now. I started just before my 30th birthday on September 4th, and aside from a few skipped days, I've stuck with it. I'm not sure how valuable these entries will be when I look back, but it'll be interesting to see what I cared about most each day. Then again, maybe these entries aren't even my truest thoughts — maybe I just always end up writing about business because my mind is constantly there.

My career is my top priority. I'm building a company, and I want to become a solo entrepreneur: build businesses that generate passive income so my financial life can run on autopilot. That's the vision. I love my current job, but I know it won't last forever. My days there are limited, so I need to act with urgency. Realistically, I should give myself 15 months to replace my income. That means working five times harder and five times smarter than I am now.

That said, I have made progress with my side projects. If I were building in public and writing a post today, it might look like this: it's been one month since I launched a paywall on Dugout Edge, my micro-SaaS that helps baseball and softball coaches manage their teams. I've made over $500 in revenue, have 30 paying customers, and 10 free trials. With only ~5% churn so far, I can reasonably expect to hit 40 paying customers within a week. Retaining about 95% of trial-to-paid users tells me the product is working and that I've hit product-market fit, even if it's on a small scale. At ~20% conversion from site visitors, marketing could potentially bring in 300–400 customers.

One of the biggest lessons here: finding the balance between shipping fast and shipping what people want is more art than science. I could've rushed a launch without working subscription or team-saving features, but that would've led to refunds and frustration. Shipping carefully, but consistently, has kept churn low and customers happy.

Another lesson: vibe coding. I don't deeply know how to code, and I rely a lot on tools like Cloud Code or Cursor, but I get the best results when I don't just blindly accept outputs. Instead, I edit prompts, pay attention to each result, and iterate. Structured documents help too. If I set up a website theme, then anytime I say "brand this button," the code can reference the theme instead of reinventing the wheel. A little structure makes everything smoother.

On the topic of feedback — everyone says, validate, validate, validate. And yes, you need demand. But validation can be ultra-simple. It doesn't need to be endless research. Walk down Divisadero on a Friday night, see people lined up at the hot dog stands outside Emporium. That's validation. You know there's demand. Same with my successes so far: with my stipend and with Dugout Edge, I had a gut sense they'd work. I did light keyword research, saw a few weak solutions online, noticed 400–500 searches a month, and that was enough. I didn't need more data — I just needed to start building.

Looking back, I did take too long to build Dugout Edge, mostly because I'm still not great at coding efficiently. But I'll get better at that with time. More importantly, I'm learning to focus on what matters: not button colors or font choices, but the core trust factors that make customers believe in me and my product.

Another key: just put yourself out there. Nobody cares about you — in a freeing way. That means I can act without overthinking. After a customer call, I can send a quick follow-up. Doesn't need to be polished. Takes 20 seconds. The real trap is hesitation — getting in my own way. The truth is, I can do this. I just need to keep moving.

And one last lesson: stand on the shoulders of giants. Don't waste time reinventing what others have already perfected. There's a reason Stripe is so successful — building your own payment system is a nightmare. Let Stripe handle it. Same with other features: authentication, feature requests, analytics. Use prebuilt solutions. The point is not to reinvent the wheel but to get the wheel rolling faster.

Lastly, I need to remember to budget at least three times more time than I think for any new feature. Nothing is ever as easy as it looks. A feature request feedback section that I thought would take minutes has taken me days. Building isn't just about execution — it's about patience, persistence, and planning for the unexpected.

All in all, I feel like I've made progress in both learning and execution. I've got traction, I've got lessons under my belt, and I've got urgency pushing me forward. The pieces are there — now it's just on me to stop hesitating and build.
