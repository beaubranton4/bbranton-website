excerpt: "Oscillating between wanting to build 24/7—no opportunity like AI and coding right now—versus being 30 in the prime of life at the Vic in SF and should touch grass. Balance or extreme focus? Dugout Edge going well: 2–3 signups/day, little churn, ~60 customers if everyone converts. Worrying about seasonality and income replacement—core feature is easy to build."

I oscillate between wanting to hunker down in my office and build 24/7 because there's no opportunity like the opportunity that has presented itself with AI and coding and building websites, mobile apps, you name it—versus the fact that I'm 30 years old, in the prime of my life, at the Vic in San Francisco, and I should go outside and touch grass. Do I want balance? Or do I want extreme focus?

Things have really been going well with Dugout Edge. Still averaging two or three signups per day. Very little churn on my free trials. I think if everybody converts, I've got about 60 customers at the moment. Which is so insane and so cool. But I do worry how seasonal these trends are. And I worry that this isn't something that's going to be able to replace my income. As the key feature that people are signing up for is just so easy to build. Mine might be the best, but I do think it's probably one of the easier things to build.
