Today I want to talk about trends I've been noticing—maybe not global movements, but micro-trends happening inside my world. Things I see among my friends, online, and on social media. They feel cultural, thought-shifting, and relevant to where I'm at in life right now.

The first trend is this push toward healthier, more holistic ways of having fun and connecting with people. It feels like a lot of people are ditching alcohol and drugs for morning run clubs, cold plunges, or other activities that are both social and healthy. I think it's a good thing. Personally, as I'm about to turn 30 in two days, I've been thinking a lot about preserving my body. I want to engage in social activities that allow me to have fun, laugh, and connect with people—without hurting myself.

When I look back, most of the fun I've had in the last decade has been tied to drinking. Late nights out, bars, parties—that's where a lot of my memories come from. They were fun, but my body and my liver can only take so much. Now I find myself wanting to replicate those same feelings—the freedom, the dancing, the letting go—but without needing a chemical or mood-altering substance to get there.

The second trend I've been noticing is how people my age, after 5–10 years of desk jobs, are starting to experience back pain, hip issues, and mobility problems. Sitting all day, being sedentary—it catches up fast. I think there's a growing focus on reversing those effects: fixing posture, building mobility, and finding ways to stay pain-free.

For me, posture has been a personal struggle. I've felt pain I'm pretty sure was rooted in posture—stomach issues, stress and tension building in my neck, anxiety that felt lodged in my body. But I've learned through meditation, stretching, and just moving that a lot of this can be fixed. Opening my chest, letting my stomach relax instead of sucking it in, pulling my shoulders back—it all frees up my breath. Suddenly, I don't feel like I'm forcing each inhale.

Posture feels like this hidden root cause behind so many problems. The symptoms show up as back pain, stomach discomfort, joint aches, or tension in the neck. But really, it's posture. And while I don't know the perfect solution, I think it comes down to exercise, strengthening weak muscles, and retraining both brain and body to remember the right alignment. It's as much about mindfulness as it is about movement.

The third trend is this craving for social connection I see among people in their late 20s and early 30s. It feels like a lot of us are searching for a "third place"—a space outside of work and home where community can happen naturally.

Our generation went from college straight into working life, and then—boom—COVID hit. Isolation became normal. Many people went through depression and disconnection, and on top of that, as the world has gotten more digital, offline connection has faded even more.

Now there's this strange comfort in staying home, not talking to anyone, and letting life happen on screens. At home, everything is cozy: Netflix, games, endless books, infinite entertainment. But none of it is new. The brain doesn't process it as fresh experience—it all blends together. That's why, even after hours of being "entertained," you can still feel like you've done nothing.

Compare that to going out into the world. If I go to the gym and have a quick social interaction, it registers as something new. If I go to the grocery store, try a new restaurant, or just step into a different building, small adventures can unfold. I might chat with someone, or maybe something unexpected happens—even if it's not pleasant, like a homeless guy yelling at me—it still feels lived. It's a real story, something my brain holds onto.

That's what I think we're missing. We need those new experiences, that sense of adventure, that feeling of being grounded in the physical world. Digital connection can only go so far. What we're really craving is the randomness of real life, the bumping into people, the stories that unfold when we're out there living.
