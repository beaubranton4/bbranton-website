title: Jury Duty and Perspective

I'm on lunch break from jury duty after a painfully slow morning, with another four hours to go this afternoon. The whole process feels incredibly outdated. It's wild that they still have everyone sit in a courtroom for hours answering questions one by one when they could easily do this virtually. Even if they kept it in person, AI could automate so much of it. The judge mentioned they're short on recorders—people whose only job is to take notes. In reality, a microphone and an AI transcription system could summarize everything said and even detect bias, which is basically what the questioning is all about: determining whether someone can be fair and objective.

During the break, I walked around Civic Center, grabbed a sandwich, and just watched people. It struck me how long it's been since I've been downtown in the middle of the day—probably four or five years. Being there reminded me how diverse people are. The way they talk, dress, carry themselves—it's all so different. Working remotely and spending most of my time around people like me, I forget that. There really isn't a "majority." Everyone has their own story, and being around that diversity is grounding. It's also a good reminder that when you create for others—products, ideas, anything—you need those different perspectives to build something that actually resonates.

Back in the courtroom, you notice all sorts of human behaviors. Some people clearly love the sound of their own voice. Give them a microphone, and they'll talk endlessly, turning simple questions into five-minute speeches. It's both funny and fascinating—people just want to be heard.

The defense lawyer used some clever tactics too. He asked, "Do you remember what you had for dinner four weeks ago?" Everyone, of course, said no. Then he followed up: "Well, the events in this case happened five years ago. Would it surprise you if the defendant doesn't remember every detail? That doesn't mean he's purposely withholding information, right?" Everyone nodded along, subtly agreeing with the logic—and just like that, he planted a small seed of doubt in everyone's minds.

It's interesting how psychology plays such a huge role in these settings. Every question, every tone, every pause is calculated to influence how people think. The whole process is this strange dance between truth and performance—part law, part theater—and sitting there watching it all unfold makes you realize just how complex and layered human interaction really is.

If I was a betting man, I could tell you with 99% confidence who's going to win this case based on the jury and the lawyers. Let's see if I'm right.
