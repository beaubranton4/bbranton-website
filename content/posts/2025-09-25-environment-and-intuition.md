excerpt: "Reflecting on the power of changing environments and following gut instincts while supporting family."

I'm down here in Redwood City, staying at the Mejia's house, celebrating the birth of Noah, Danny and Tim's child. I talked a little bit yesterday about what's been going on, so I won't repeat everything, but we're all praying for him. There have been some complications with his breathing—Code Blue yesterday morning when he was pulled out during the cesarean, and again some issues this morning. It's heavy, but we're here to support Danny, Tim, and the rest of the family.

Putting that aside for now—if only to distract myself from the weight of it—I want to reflect on two things: the power of changing your environment, and following your gut.

Right now, I'm sitting in the Mejia's backyard. The sun is out. It's a perfect 68, maybe 69 degrees. There's this overwhelming sense of calm—listening to birds chirping, feeling the sun warm my face. Even something as simple as drinking their coffee at the dining room table feels refreshing.

It makes me think about how important it is to step into new environments. To continuously experience new things, trigger our senses in different ways. It feels like fuel for the brain, and even for the body. I want to remind myself to do this more often. Go to coffee shops. Work from different places. Even if I'm just sitting behind a laptop, the shift in scenery brings a different energy.

There's a secret sauce in it. I feel instantly more motivated, more inspired. Maybe it's because I'm not stuck repeating the patterns of the past. Maybe it's the reminder that there are endless possibilities—that I actually can change. If I can change my environment, I can change the outcome of my day. Maybe even the outcome of my life. That's empowering.

Which brings me to the second topic: following your gut.

This morning, I came across an ad on Facebook from a guy named Mike Mack, a Chinese-American down in San Jose who owns a batting cage. He's putting that batting cage up for sale. And the moment I saw it, I got this deep butterfly sensation in my stomach—the kind that makes you sit up and pay attention. It was like my body saying: this is exciting, this has your name written all over it.

I don't get those feelings often. Honestly, I can't even remember the last time I did. But I know the body and the mind have a way of signaling what matters. It's not just random—it's instinct, intuition. And when it shows up, it usually means something. These are the tipping points, the "main character" events in life that could alter the entire trajectory of where things go next.

So far, I haven't done anything. But I feel like I need to act on it—today. Not tomorrow, not next week. Today. I should reach out to him, ask how much it costs, talk financials. Just do it. Just follow the gut. People always say the heart and gut are connected, and I believe that. These sensations, these sudden feelings—they're not noise, they're direction.

Of course, my brain is already chiming in: It's too far. Batting cages aren't good businesses. There are a hundred reasons not to. But that initial gut reaction? It's signaling something bigger, something great on the horizon.

So cheers to that. Cheers to following the butterflies and seeing where they lead. Maybe to San Jose batting cages. Maybe to something else entirely. Either way, I trust that sensation.
