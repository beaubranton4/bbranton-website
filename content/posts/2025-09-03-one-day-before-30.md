One day before my 30th birthday—my last day in my twenties.

Today was fairly uneventful. It started like most days: I woke up, logged into my remote job as a data analyst, took a few calls, and then had the rest of the day to spend as I pleased. From 10:30 to 12:30 I worked out. I went on a three-mile run at a pretty fast pace, averaging around 7:45 per mile, then followed it up with an ab workout at the gym. After a shower, I came home, spent an hour or two working and responding to Slack messages, took a nap, and then went for a walk.

Now I have the whole afternoon and evening to myself—for journaling, working on personal projects, and watching baseball. It was a good day, though nothing out of the ordinary. I'd rate it a six out of ten. The best days for me are when I'm outside and moving, and today did have that. But what it was missing was human connection. Outside of spending time with Abby—something I'm grateful for every day—I didn't have those interactions that bring fun and laughter. And I think that's what I value most in life.

As I approach my 30th trip around the sun, I've been reflecting on how much of an impact baseball has had on my life—and how much it still does. From a young age, it was the thing I was most drawn to. But throughout my twenties, I tried to distance myself from it because I didn't want my entire identity tied to being "the baseball guy." Deep down, I knew my playing days were limited, and I think I was protecting myself for the moment when I'd have to stop. That moment came seven years ago, when I retired from minor league baseball at 22.

For a long time, I carried this idea that maybe I wasn't good enough to make it, and that if I didn't branch out—develop other skills and interests—then failing at baseball would mean failing at life. But I see now that isn't true at all. If anything, what feels more cowardly is that I didn't allow myself to fully commit to the one thing I loved most in this world.

That said, just because I look back with some remorse about how I approached my one true love and how I walked away, it doesn't mean I feel it was the wrong choice. Walking away from the game opened up the past seven or eight years of my life, which have been incredibly fruitful and fulfilling in ways I never could have experienced on a baseball field. Sure, if I had made it, there might have been fame, influence, money, and the chance to inspire kids who idolize the game. But realistically, there was a 95% chance it would have been wasted effort—years grinding with little to show for it. In that sense, I'm glad I chose to step away and go work for Disney. That decision was the right one for me at the time.

Still, I find myself increasingly drawn back to the game—not as a player chasing the majors, but in different ways. Building Dugout Edge has been incredibly fulfilling. It lets me combine the skills I've picked up in computers, data, coding, business strategy, and online entrepreneurship with the game I love. And more than that, it allows me to help others who share that same love and who are trying to get better at baseball.

Beyond the business side, I've also realized that baseball still finds its way into my life in so many forms. I love coaching, being able to pass along knowledge and encourage others. I love watching the game, keeping up with players and storylines, following the rhythms of the season. Fantasy baseball has been another outlet—a different kind of strategy, competition, and connection to the sport. And lately, I've even found myself thinking about starting a wiffleball league. That scratches a different itch: the playfulness of sport, the camaraderie, the simplicity of just grabbing a bat, a ball, and some friends and turning any patch of grass into a field. It's baseball in its purest, most joyful form.

All of these things—coaching, watching, building tools like Dugout Edge, even just playing fantasy or wiffleball—are reminders that baseball doesn't have to be all or nothing. It's not just about being a professional player or not playing at all. It's about the many ways the game can weave into my life and continue to bring fulfillment.

And that's really what I'm focused on now: fulfillment. When I was in college or in my early twenties, I always said, "I just want to be happy." But I've realized happiness is just an emotion—it comes and goes. Fulfillment is different. It's lasting. It's a way of living, a deep sense of knowing you're spending your time and energy in a way that matters. Fulfillment is found in the way you live every moment of every day.

So here's to fulfillment. Here's to 30. And here's to me.
