title: "Double Down vs. Well-Rounded"

excerpt: "Oscillating between doubling down on one thing (like baseball) and trying everything to become the most well-rounded person. They feel mutually exclusive. Focus is fulfilling and creates the illusion of progress; working on many things lets dots converge later. Maybe the approach: try a bunch, learn, spread attention—then niche down when you know what you're passionate about."

I oscillate between wanting to double down on one thing just like I did on baseball and trying everything—becoming the most well-rounded person on planet Earth. I don't think that the two of these are possible simultaneously. They are mutually exclusive. The question is which leads to a better outcome?

I know that focus—knowing what I need to work on every single day and putting hours toward that—is an extremely fulfilling feeling and provides the illusion of progress. But I also believe that when you work on many things at once, things start to converge. Not immediately, but when you look backwards and connect the dots, there was a purpose for all of them. It's the same reason why playing multiple sports as a kid growing up probably made me a better baseball player. The thing is that I eventually did niche down and only focus on baseball, but it wasn't until my freshman year of high school that I finally gave up every single other sport.

So maybe that is the approach that I take. Try a bunch of things, learn a bunch of things, multitask, share my attention, spread my attention across many different industries, interests, curiosities. That will allow me to understand what it is that I truly am passionate about, what I want to focus on, where I want to spend my time. And only then can I make that decision to double down and focus.

On a separate note, I'm thinking about collecting as much information as possible about myself, how I interact with cloud code, obviously starting here with these journals, what's going on in my brain, but I need to start being able to interact and train data on how I'm how I'm making decisions on my computer so that I can feed it to an AI and one day simulate my own decisions as well instead of having me prompt and prompt and prompt hopefully I can automate prompting as well.
