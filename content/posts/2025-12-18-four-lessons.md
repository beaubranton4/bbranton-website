"A donkey works harder than the rest of us, but it ain't rich."

I saw this saying a few days ago and it really stuck with me. Basically the point is that hard work is not always rewarded. Smart work often is. The men who were down in the coal mines swinging their pickaxes are working hard. But the smart ones, the ones who financed the operations, the ones who architected and strategized and figured out how to get the coal out via capital, via time, via operational excellence, those are the ones who are getting rich, and not risking their lives to do it.

I also had this thought yesterday that the world of venture capital, take YC for example, kind of fits this mold. YC to me are like the owners of the coal mines and the startup founders while glamorized by society and social media. Those are the actual coal miners. Sure, I think that many of them do get rich and it's much more of a symbiotic relationship than coal miners and mine operators and mine owners. But you're still trading a good chunk of your life and that's what we have. To build something that maybe you don't necessarily want to build, I think that probably 50% of those founders are chasing wealth and status rather than doing things for the sake of doing things. After all, what do exited startup founders end up doing? They get into investing. They don't go off and start a company. Many times. The ones that love it, I think do. But it seems like you put in your time and then you do what people really want to do, which is allocate capital, sit back on your hind legs, relax, watch and get rich.

That is lesson one I'm starting to realize and I'm starting to learn that I can put as much time as I want into building some sort of tool. But if no one wants it, if the grand vision is not big enough, it may not pay off. And that's where I'm struggling a little bit right now between do I continue working on dugout edge or do I go on to bigger and better things. So that's lesson one. Don't work harder, work smarter.

I have three other lessons for you today. Really lessons for myself that I'd like to reiterate and to reemphasize. I probably discussed them before in my journals.

The first is that I need to follow my passion. I need to follow the fun. I need to follow the curiosity without being afraid to do so. I think for so much of my life I do things because my brain tells me it's the correct thing to do. I went into consulting spent a year trying to get a job there, even after getting an internship and realizing that I hated it. I still went down that path. Luckily, the cards fell in a way that I had no other option but to look for other jobs. And that was a blessing in disguise.

But I continually think back to when I was a kid and all I cared about was baseball. All I loved was baseball and it led me down an incredible and adventurous and fulfilling path that I could have never foreseen. So it's not a guaranteed. I don't think that everybody would be, you know, even if I did this a hundred times over, I'm not sure I would be as fortunate as I am today. But the work came easy.

That leads me to my next lesson in that, you know, preparing, planning, strategizing. It's important, but don't use it as a form of procrastination. You can tell yourself all you want on listening to podcasts to learn more about business when in reality, you're just delaying the inevitable. You're procrastinating the actual activity that's going to make you better, which is starting the business. Quit doing the things that are easy in exchange for the things that are hard.

I suppose this is a dual lesson in that we should be doing the hard things. Although counterintuitive to my previous point of you should work hard, but I think working hard in the grand scheme of directing your efforts to something is different than being faced with two decisions and choosing the hard path versus the easy path. Now, I'm realizing that's extremely, extremely conflicting. But I think all of us deep down know the difference between working smart and working hard and choosing the hard thing versus choosing the easy thing. There's a slight difference. I'm not sure I can elaborate it and articulate it right now because I should keep going.

Lesson four. And I've talked about this before, but bad habits stack. I need to remember that one decision leads to a next. I don't work out. I don't feel good the next morning. I'm less likely to work on my projects and then I'm going to eat less healthy. And then it's an never-ending cycle of just feeling bad and not doing the things that I want, not doing the things that I need.

I would say that I need to remember how I felt the week when I got back from Switzerland, which was 10 days of being clean, not depleting my dopamine through various forms of bad habits. And I was so motivated every single morning I woke up refreshed, ready to go, driven, motivated. I've fallen back into the habits of old and while I'm still making pretty good progress, I think that's just because I have the time to think and work without worrying about my day. I'm not worrying about my day job at the moment, but if that wasn't the case, I don't think I'd be making as much progress.

But as long as I have a direction and I'm clear that that's the direction that I want to be going on, that's when I put pedal to the metal. That's when working hard will pay off.
