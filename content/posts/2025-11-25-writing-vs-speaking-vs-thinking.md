Today I write my journal entry because the output is much clearer when I have time to collect my thoughts. The time between thinking a thought, letting it marinate, and then typing it out on a keyboard gives my brain a chance to structure it. When I’m speaking out loud, that buffer doesn’t exist. I am a much better writer than I am a speaker, and I’m an even better thinker than I am a writer. I want to close the gap between those three areas of expression as much as I can.

“Be chalant about things.” What does that mean? It's the opposite of being non-chalant. I used to think that not caring and not trying was cool. It meant you couldn't look stupid when you fail. The truth is, you look stupid anyways when you're that non-chalant

Find low-competition businesses. Probably the best type of business for me is an in-person community or physical thing instead of competing with all the people who are actually good with tech. My businesses should be a reflection of me. I have to quit trying to show people that I’m smart, and just help people.

Many entrepreneurs are actually risk minimizers. They find the way to succeed while taking the least amount of risk. The outcome is uncertain but not risky.


Don’t start with technology and look for a problem. Find a problem that deeply needs to be solved. The more intimate you are with the problem, the better. Then find the best solution to solve that problem and bring it to life.

I found these two very nice sites that are essentially mini apps or tools in the form of a web browser. Leverage search engine optimization. Build a tool to solve a very specific pain point right on that page. Rank for it, then let it ride.

I’m pretty certain that companies that are remote-only will fail. I’m fairly certain of this after working at a company that has been fully remote since COVID. These companies will not be as good or as strong as companies that meet in person on a weekly basis. That is why, for this short period of time in history where remote work is still a thing, I will never give up this job—because it is an arbitrage opportunity. It is one of the easiest jobs on the planet. You still need to be able to do the work, no question. But you can play charades. If you just seem like you’re doing work, you’ll be fine. I have seen so many people do so little and still keep their six-figure salary.

We are at a rare moment in history where this makes as much money, or more, than jobs that are way harder and require so much more sacrifice. And for the first thousands of years of human existence, and for the thousands of years that humans have done “work,” remote work has only existed for a decade or two—0.0001% of humanity’s history. And that is why I think I have the greatest job in the world.
