The word of the day for me is grateful. I think I often feel grateful, but right now it’s especially strong. The past month or two of my life has been incredible—getting to go to Chile, spending a wild weekend in Las Vegas with 27 friends, working hard on Dugout Edge, and actually seeing that effort pay off. I’ve made $350 so far, nearly $100 in monthly recurring revenue, in under a month. That’s insane for such a tiny little vibe-coded app.

And now, Portola is this weekend. Life just feels full right now. I’m grateful for it all. It’s been a great start to my 30th birthday year—my next trip around the sun.

I keep going back and forth in my head: do I want to take what I’ve learned from building websites, apps, and vibe-coded projects into something brand new? Or should I just double down on Dugout Edge? It’s a niche I’m passionate about, something I actually care about, and it’s fun. The competition is low. My only hesitation is the market size—it feels small. But maybe I’m underestimating it. Maybe I can expand to leagues, college programs, high school coaches. The truth is, I don’t think I can afford to pivot right now. I should take Dugout Edge as far as it can go.

One thing I’m disappointed in myself about: I still cave to some of my bad habits—junk food, smoking weed, even dumb stuff like picking at zits. I know these things hurt me, and I’m better than I was last year—I’ve made progress and I know how to quit—but I’m still not all the way there. Moderation has been good, but it’s still not the level I want. I need more urgency. No more “tomorrows.”

On the flip side, I’ve been eating healthier overall, and that matters. But weekends derail me—greasy food binges, eating whatever’s around. Balance is hard. Still, I think I’m doing okay—probably in the top 20% of people in terms of taking care of myself. But I want to be in the top 5%—mentally, physically, spiritually.

I can also see my future more clearly now: being a builder. That part feels certain. But the part that’s missing is human connection. I’m great at working solo, but to reach my full potential I need to lean on others—teamwork, collaboration, outsourcing, offloading. It’s strange to admit, but I find myself talking more like a VC bro every day. Maybe it’s the algorithm, maybe it’s just the bubble I’m in. I can’t tell if it’s good or bad, but it’s where I am.

Lastly, I keep circling back to the idea of being a comedian. There’s something in me that lights up when I come across a hilarious video and think, “I could’ve made that.” Nothing gives me as much joy as making a witty wise crack comment. I love the idea of being the funny guy that makes people laugh. Maybe I don’t need to chase it as a career—maybe I can just weave that joy into my day-to-day life.
