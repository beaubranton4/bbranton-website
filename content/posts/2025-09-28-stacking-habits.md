This morning I'm thinking about how my body might hate me. I've drank pretty heavily for the last decade—probably twice a week on average—and that just cannot be good for my body, my liver, or my internal organs. I really need to cut back. The issue is that my friends love to drink, and truthfully, I love it too. It's fun, it's social. But I need to find a way to have that kind of fun without drinking.

In some ways, maybe it's good that we spend more nights in now on the couch. But we've kind of replaced drinking with another bad habit—taking an edible or smoking weed, then sitting around eating junk food. Really, those nights should be replaced with "normal" nights. We can still watch TV, maybe have a little snack, but the goal should be to get to bed by 10 and wake up early for a run. Those are the weekends I aspire to.

The truth is, this current setup doesn't give me much. It's fun in the moment, but it leaves me with nothing the next day. Today, at least, I've got a full list of things to do and I'm pretty sure I can get them all done. I don't feel too bad, but I need to make sure I'm not stacking bad habits. Because that's the thing—habits stack.

When you drink, the next day you crave junk food. When you eat junk food, you get lazy. Then all you want to do is sit on the couch and watch TV instead of doing the things you know you should. But good habits stack too. You go for a run, and suddenly you're thinking about what to eat. You don't want to waste a good run, so you eat a solid meal. After that, you feel good, so you sit down to journal or meditate. You knock out the things you wanted to do that day. Then, because you were productive, you feel fulfilled, you're naturally tired, and you go to bed early. Good habits stack.

Another thing I need to work on, if I want to be an entrepreneur—or solopreneur—is getting comfortable talking to people, putting myself out there, and taking action. When I saw that ad for the batting cage for sale in San Jose on Thursday, I should have taken action right then. Instead, I've waited three days, procrastinating. I've been putting it off because I'm afraid—afraid to put myself out there, afraid to send a message that says, "I'm interested."

But what's the worst that could happen? The guy who built that cage is probably a lot like me. He probably shares similar interests. Even if I don't end up buying it, I'd benefit from the conversation. And even if I look silly, who cares? I need to get comfortable putting my name out there. So today, that's my goal. If I can text him, that'll be my big win.

Here's to stacking good habits, taking action, and acting swiftly.
