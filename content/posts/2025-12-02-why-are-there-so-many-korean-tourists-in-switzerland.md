It seems like everywhere we go, the percentage of Korean tourists is about 90%. I wonder if it's "Crash Landing on You" or you know, K-dramas that took place here and popularized these locations, or if it's maybe just Switzerland itself—the magnificent beauty, the cleanliness, the safety, the lack of sun. Just one observation I've had.

Spent the day in Grindelwald and went up to Grindelwald First, another mountain. A little less spectacular and as high as Jungfrau, but arguably a better experience. A lot less structured in the experience and optionality to roam the mountain. The kids did a zip line down the mountain—basically a four person on your belly glider that actually has an eagle atop of it. Took us up going backwards up the mountain and then shot us right back down. Two minute experience. Pretty darn fun. Got the blood rushing. Ate sandwiches atop the mountain with these black birds with the yellow beaks circling above. And then took some metal bridges to some viewpoints that overlooked the entire valley and landscape of mountain ranges which was truly incredible. A little bit scary when you look down but incredible nonetheless.

Finished with fondue in the city at the Belvedere hotel where they served us in our own little gondola. True Swiss fondue only comes with potatoes and bread apparently, but it was the best fondue I've had thus far.

It's fun going to grocery stores in different countries. I like looking at the packaging and seeing how different the brands look here compared to back home.

I secretly search for inspiration in branding and in words that could spark ideas for brands that I can "copy" and use in America as inspiration.

I was really fascinated by Montbell, a luxury outdoor brand started by a Japanese mountaineer who climbed Mont Blanc. They make really high quality and luxury outdoor equipment. Think Patagonia. Lowkey just sleeping bags for every part of your body.
