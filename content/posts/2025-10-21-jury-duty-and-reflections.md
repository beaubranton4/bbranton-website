Had jury duty today. Absolute colossal waste of time. I can't believe that they make 50+ people do that for one case every single week, five days of the week. In San Francisco alone, there were probably three or four other groups of 50 called. I can't even imagine how many people are just wasting their time. About 50% of the people would just say, "Nope, can't go, sorry." First of all, they already waste 2-3 hours of their day just getting there. It's annoying. Anyways, I have to go back on Thursday, but I did get a free day off of work for it. So, sick Monday, jury duty Tuesday, work Wednesday, jury duty Thursday. I basically got a two-day work week, so that's interesting.

Got a lot of work done on Dugout Edge today. Still feeling sick. Still coughing, hacking my lungs out while I was sleeping last night. It's always a good reminder how important it is to take care of your health, because I haven't been able to do what I enjoy, haven't been able to do much really. Which is why I put a good 3-4 hours into Dugout Edge today. Fleshed out the practice plans, drills, website, the practice planner. I think everything looks really good now. The organization is how I want it to be. I've consolidated pages so that I don't have individual category pages. Now I've just got one page ranking for baseball drills, one page ranking for softball drills, and so on. I think this will be a good idea, because ultimately my goal is to get people looking at these drills saying, "Oh, actually, you know, it would be better to have a practice planner, something that helps me create these practice plans."

The great thing is every week, every month, a new parent is drawn into, is volunteered with the task of becoming a youth baseball or youth softball coach. And I want to build tools for those parents to help make their lives easier. That's plain and simple. That's all I'm trying to do.

Other than that, I keep thinking that I may be hitting a wall. I think it's because I'm not getting the positive feedback. I'm not getting signups. I think if I was getting signups every single day, this would totally change my perspective on things. But now it's hard to build in winter, but it's the wintertime when you make your money. You prepare, you stockpile goods, you build your wall, and you prepare for spring. So that's kind of my philosophy.

I think I need to see this through. I need to give Dugout Edge a full, fledged shot. Don't give up prematurely. But there are signs saying to myself, "Maybe this isn't it." And I'm not sure if it isn't it because I'm not passionate about it. I do enjoy building, but I think I don't enjoy building with no reward. Which is kind of a very human nature sort of thing. Or maybe it's that deep down I know that this isn't the business that's going to replace my income—or is it?

To me, I think that number is just $100,000. If I can make a consistent $100,000 in profit every year from a business, I think I'm good. I just need to 100x from here. That's just a 10x and 10x. Can I do that in two years with Dugout Edge? Maybe, I'm not too sure. I'm not 100% confident. I feel like if I was selling $50,000 customers or contracts, maybe it's a little bit more achievable, a little bit more attainable. But then again, my costs would probably be through the roof. I'd probably need to hire some people. Given my criteria of bootstrapping, maybe this is what it is.

And there's nothing wrong with starting a new project in December, multitasking a little bit. I have AI agents now. I'm 10 times more productive than I would have been one year ago. That's the incredible thing—it really, really is incredible.

On another note, met with the neighbors today to discuss painting bids. At the end of the day, I ended up finding the one that everyone kind of agreed on. Didn't seem like everyone tried all that hard. Fine with me, totally fine with me. They really seemed like they wanted to get out of the house today, I don't know what it was, something scared them or intimidated them. In either case, I think we're all good with the decision. I kind of wish we were saving a little bit more money. I think we could go with Vera's contractor, which would save us $10,000 ($2,500 or $3,000 each). But ultimately, if we just get this thing over with, that would be great too. And delaying this as long as possible is just another pro for me because that'll just be a fresher paint job by the time we sell or rent this place out.

We'll see what happens. I think we'll end up probably going with McCartney's painting, going with Kieran who did a great job giving the quote. He did a good job answering all the questions, was super knowledgeable, sent an amazing quote. It's actually kind of crazy how easy it is to win these jobs—obviously you need to do a good job too, but I really think just being a lead magnet, like having a business where I'm the marketing side of a home renovation or home construction job/contractor sort of deal seems like a super lucrative business, especially here in San Francisco.
