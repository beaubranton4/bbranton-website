It's a beautiful Saturday, and I'm a little bit hungover from last night. Got dinner and drinks with the Stanford baseball alum squad — about 15 to 20 of us. It was great to see so many familiar faces and catch up after years apart. There was real star power at the table — four big leaguers, one WNBA player, and even a social media star. Just a good crew. The whole night had that easy, fun energy that makes you forget about time for a bit.

On a sadder note, I completely missed my dad's birthday yesterday. His real birthday is on the 17th, but technically, he also has a "government" birthday on the 19th, which always throws me off. Still, that's no excuse. I realized it today and felt that little pang of guilt hit. I reached out — better late than never — but it still made me sad that I forgot.

As for Dugout Edge, yesterday I worked on simplifying the practice plan page architecture. I realized I don't need a page for every single plan. What I actually need is a single, searchable library where coaches can easily browse, view, and download what they need. It'll make for a better user experience and serve as a great lead magnet funnel into the main Dugout Edge software.

One thing I've been putting off is creating the actual templates. It's mostly design work in Canva, which for whatever reason, I've been procrastinating on. I thought the MCP might help me automate some of that, but it's not quite capable yet — especially when it comes to editing tools. Still, sharing bits and pieces of this process could be great content. People would probably love to see what the Canva MCP can actually do in real-world use.

Tweeting about it is fine, but I think it would work way better as video content. If I had a tool that could record my screen, capture my voice as I talk through things, and automatically clip it into something postable — that would be huge. That kind of "show your work" agent would be a game changer.

On the bright side, the drills library I built for Dugout Edge is already paying off. I can see the results — more views, more sign-ups, and more engagement overall. Every little SaaS feature and piece of content I've created so far has brought something in return. It's motivating, and I just want to keep that momentum going.

I've been thinking a lot about how "showing my work" fits into this next phase. It might not directly resonate with the average baseball coach, but it could help me personally — building trust, documenting progress, and maybe inspiring others who want to build something themselves.

To close today's reflection, I'll leave it with a bit of inspiration I picked up from a woman on Instagram. She only has about a thousand followers but somehow has a blue checkmark — which, honestly, might be worth paying for if I ever start posting seriously. She used to be a CFO but quit her job to focus on making content and building a personal finance app. Her posts are thoughtful and authentic, and one in particular stuck with me. It said something like: "Don't give up on the things you think about every day."

That hit hard. It's such a simple truth, but one that I really needed to hear. Because I have given up before — on something I used to think about constantly — and I don't want to make that mistake again. This time, I want to follow through. Maybe this is my chance to redeem myself — to quit my job, go all in on content, build and create companies, meet amazing people, inspire others, laugh more, and enjoy life.
