# How to Build a Website from Scratch Using Agentic Coding Agents

*Just a warning: this was written by AI - but it is based on the blueprint I follow for creating sites. FYI, it says this was 50-60 hours of development work. It took 3-4 hours.*

The landscape of web development has fundamentally changed with the advent of agentic coding agents like Cursor and Claude Code. What used to take weeks of development work can now be accomplished in a matter of hours. Here's the comprehensive blueprint I follow for creating professional websites from scratch.

## The Foundation Phase

### 1. Creating claude.md
Start by creating a comprehensive project specification document. This becomes your AI agent's north star throughout the development process. Include:
- Project goals and objectives
- Target audience definition
- Feature requirements
- Technical specifications
- Design preferences

### 2. Creating the Feel and Theme
Find inspiration sites that capture the aesthetic you're aiming for. This isn't about copying - it's about establishing a visual direction that your AI agent can understand and implement. Screenshot key pages and note specific elements you want to incorporate.

### 3. Design Architecture for Pages
Based on your site type and SEO best practices, map out your page structure:
- Homepage layout and sections
- Product/service pages
- Blog architecture
- Category pages
- Navigation structure
- Footer elements

## The Technical Setup

### 4. Setup Vercel/Domain/Supabase
Configure your hosting and database infrastructure:
- Initialize Next.js project
- Connect to Vercel for deployment
- Set up custom domain
- Configure Supabase (if database functionality needed)
- Establish environment variables

### 5. Core Development
Let your AI agent handle the heavy lifting:
- Design system creation
- Component architecture
- Database schema design
- API route implementation
- Responsive design implementation

## Content Creation Phase

### 6. Write 10-20 SEO Optimized Articles
Content is king for organic traffic. Have your AI agent help create:
- Keyword-researched blog posts
- Product descriptions
- Landing page copy
- About page content
- FAQ sections

### 7. Product/Service Curation
Depending on your site type:
- 8-10 core products/services
- Detailed descriptions
- High-quality images
- Pricing information
- Feature comparisons

## The Time Revolution

**Traditional Development:** 40-60 hours of focused development
**With AI Agents:** 3-4 hours of guided development

The key difference isn't just speed - it's the quality and comprehensiveness of what gets built. AI agents don't get tired, don't make typos, and can implement best practices consistently across your entire site.

## Key Success Factors

1. **Clear Communication:** The better your initial specifications, the better your results
2. **Iterative Refinement:** Work with your AI agent to refine and improve
3. **Strategic Thinking:** Focus on strategy and direction while AI handles implementation
4. **Quality Control:** Review and test everything before going live

## The Future of Web Development

This isn't just about building websites faster - it's about democratizing professional web development. Anyone with a clear vision and basic technical understanding can now create sophisticated, professional websites that would have required a full development team just a few years ago.

The bottleneck is no longer technical implementation - it's having a clear vision of what you want to build and why.

*Total Estimated Time with AI Agents: 3-4 hours of focused work*
*Traditional Estimated Time: 40-60 hours of development*

The revolution is here. The question isn't whether you should use AI agents for web development - it's how quickly you can adapt your workflow to leverage them effectively.


TO DO

-- need to get better at applying leverage via capital. I have a system i think could work for validating next ideas, but it's taking too long to build. i should pay 10,000 to make it happen in a few weeks.
