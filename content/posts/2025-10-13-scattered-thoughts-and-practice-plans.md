My mind's been a little scattered lately—probably from having too much fun and spending too much time scrolling on my phone. It's like my focus has been diluted. I've been having a lot of interesting ideas, but they're bouncing around in my head with no clear direction. I keep thinking about things that need to get done, ways I can improve, projects I could start next, and what I'm actually interested in right now. My interests just keep hopping from one thing to another—classic shiny object syndrome.

One of the ideas that's been bouncing around is this concept of micro sports betting—basically an AI-generated sports league where everything happens digitally, but it's still statistically trackable, so people could bet on outcomes. Kind of like creating an online casino, but for simulated sports. It's an interesting thought, but honestly, I probably don't want to get into that world. It's a bit murky, and I don't think it aligns with what I want to build long term.

Then there's the recurring idea of creating a physical space—something fun, like a batting cage or a social hangout spot. I've been thinking about that one for a while. It'd be awesome to create a space where people could go, have fun, and connect. But the downside is the difficulty of execution—it's expensive, operationally heavy, and hard to scale. Still, there's something appealing about building something tangible that people can actually experience in the real world.

That ties into another thought: the appeal of physical products. In today's world where everything's digital, it feels like building something physical might actually be an advantage. Maybe not "the next big thing," but a less crowded playing field. Everyone's chasing SaaS or digital products, so maybe physical innovation is quietly underrated. I've thought about making a better batting machine, or even a robot that could hit fungos and catch balls too. That'd be a seriously cool piece of tech for baseball training.

And then, of course, my mind always drifts back to hats. I keep coming back to this idea of a high-quality, sporty workout hat—something sleek and functional, kind of like what Lululemon did for athletic wear. A hat that doesn't collapse or lose shape, that feels premium and instantly becomes your go-to for workouts or runs. Like, "you're heading to the gym? Throw this on." It's your pair of Lulus, but for your head.

But when I zoom out, I keep thinking about how the real money is in B2B, not D2C. Direct-to-consumer is familiar and feels approachable, but the bigger opportunities lie in building for businesses—helping other people make money. That's always an easier sell. The easiest thing to justify spending money on is something that will help you earn more.

As I continue building Dugout Edge, I want to think about what kinds of problems I've personally faced while running it. Dugout Edge might be small, but it's still a business. And if I can build something useful for other small to mid-sized companies—say those making $10K to $1M ARR—I could be onto something. Even a $50–$100/month SaaS that solves a specific pain point for small business owners could scale nicely.

I think about companies like Vercel and Supabase. They offer so much value for free, but once you're in their ecosystem, you're essentially locked in—and that's where they make their money. It's a brilliant model. I'd love to build something like that: a product so useful that people depend on it, and paying for it feels natural.

Over the weekend, I actually got a little work done on Dugout Edge—maybe an hour or two of focused work before Fleet Week, and a little more yesterday. Not as much as I probably should have, but motivation comes and goes. During that time, I started shaping a clearer plan for the practice plan section. I made some decent progress organizing the structure of the accompanying article, which helped me clarify the broader funnel concept for the feature itself.

The idea is to have a public-facing practice plan page where coaches can browse sample plans for free. That page would funnel into the practice plan generator, which then leads into Dugout Edge Premium. Similar to the lineup generator: offer something genuinely useful for free, but gate the best features behind a subscription.

The flow would look like this:
1. Visitors land on the practice plans page and view a few free templates.
2. They try generating their own customized plan for free.
3. When they want to save or download the plan, they're prompted to subscribe.

Coaches would input details like roster size, age group, number of players attending, number of coaches, available equipment, and focus areas. Then the generator would create a customized, detailed practice plan.

The most important next step is designing the final formatted output—a clean, coach-friendly layout that can serve as the anchor for everything else. Once I have that, I can reverse-engineer the technical implementation. Starting with a handful of example templates, maybe one or two per age group, will show visitors exactly what they can get. After that, it's about figuring out technical feasibility: collecting user inputs, dynamically generating plans, and storing them for logged-in users.

If I get the final deliverable right—something that genuinely saves coaches time and gives them a structured, professional-looking plan—the rest of the funnel should fall naturally into place. This feels like the clearest, most actionable path forward right now.
