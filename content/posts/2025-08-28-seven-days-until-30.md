I'm seven days away from turning 30—September 4th, 2025. Thirty feels like a strange milestone. For whatever reason, it's one of those round numbers that makes you think about aging, about where you are in life. Statistically, it's not even halfway through an average lifespan, but it carries a weight. It feels like you're supposed to be a full-fledged adult by now.

But I don't feel that way. I still feel like I have my whole life ahead of me, like I could be anything I want. And in some ways that's true. But in others, it's not. I've already curated a certain path—career, relationships, where I live. It's not like I can just drop everything tomorrow and become an artist or an architect. Technically, I could—plenty of people start later in life—but practically, I've spent years developing a specific skill set. The realistic thing now is to assess where I am, accept that foundation, and move forward with it.

The truth is, I'm not happy with where I'm at. I'm a data analyst at a tech company, and objectively it's probably one of the best jobs in the world. I work maybe two or three hours a day, I make $185,000 a year, and even in San Francisco that's enough to live a comfortable life. I could coast forever like this. I could support my family, have financial stability, and live easily.

But something inside me isn't satisfied. For the past seven, eight, maybe even nine years—going back to college—I've had this persistent itch. I want to start my own company. It's not even about "the company" itself. What excites me is the idea of creating something, building value, putting something out into the world.

Of course, the financial side matters too. I want to be wealthy. I want freedom with my time. I want to own my days. And I believe building a company is the best way to get there—to have both financial wealth and time wealth. That's what I crave: freedom, fulfillment, the ability to support my family and loved ones on my own terms.

Which is why I keep circling back to this: I want to quit my job and go all in. I know it won't pay off right away—maybe not for one, two, five, even ten years. But when I look out at my life from the vantage point of 50 or 60 years old, I'm confident that if I devote myself completely to building businesses, learning, networking, honing my craft, I will succeed. I'll fail along the way too, sure, but in the long run I see entrepreneurship as actually less risky than staying where I am.

The dilemma is obvious: the safety net of this job is incredible. Since I only work a few hours a day, in theory I could keep one foot in, one foot out—work the job, use my free time to build a business. But part of me worries that's the wrong approach. That split mindset might hold me back.

It reminds me of when I was a kid and decided to quit every other sport to focus only on baseball. There were clear benefits to playing multiple sports, and maybe I could have been just as good at baseball if I kept them all. But narrowing my focus simplified everything. No more juggling—just one clear path forward. That's what quitting a job for entrepreneurship would feel like: blinders on, no distractions, waking up every day with one mission.

And I know myself—I thrive when I have a singular focus. I don't stop until the job is done. Which is why, deep down, I think I need to quit my job.

If I do, I already have a plan in mind. The smart thing would be to make an announcement on social media—let people know I'm taking the leap. From there, I'd start building in public. Every day I'd share something: maybe a picture of me writing, maybe a snippet of these journal entries, maybe just raw thoughts on what I'm learning or what I'm building. I'd put it all out there for people to follow along.

I think it would resonate. There are so many people out there who dream of making the jump but are too scared, and I'd be someone they could root for—someone in the middle of it, not polished or "made" yet, but striving. It's relatable. It's real. And being in that uncomfortable position, fully exposed, would force me to succeed.
