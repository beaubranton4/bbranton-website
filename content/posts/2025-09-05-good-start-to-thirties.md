excerpt: 'I made $40 worth of MRR on Dugout Edge (my microsaas) today!'

This one’s going to be a short one. I’m super excited about Dugout Edge right now—I made $40 in one day! That came from one annual subscription, one monthly subscription, and I’ve got seven people currently on the free trial who are willing to pay once their seven-day trial ends. Considering I’ve only been live for about a week, that’s huge. If all goes well, I’ll be making around $25 to $40 in monthly recurring revenue after just the first week. It’s not a massive amount, but it’s real progress, and I’m stoked about it.

I still need to get everything properly set up in Stripe, and there’s a little bit of stress there since this project started out as just a small side thing. But it’s exciting that I get to build this, learn as I go, and hopefully watch it grow into something bigger.

On another note, I’m also really excited for tonight. I get to hang out with some old friends—Bill and Anna, plus a few others I haven’t seen in a month. That feels like such a long time, so it’ll be good to reconnect. Then tomorrow I’ve got wiffle ball lined up, which makes me even happier.

All in all, I might even skip journaling tomorrow just because I’m busy actually enjoying life. Getting outdoors, spending time with people I care about, and having fun—that’s exactly what I’ve been aiming for. Day one of 30 feels like it’s off to a really good start.
