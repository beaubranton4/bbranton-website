Woke up today with my health and my body being top of mind. I've been having bouts of hip SI joint and sciatica pain again. It's likely a combination of my old left knee injury forcing me to put a bit more stress on my right hip, plus swimming yesterday probably aggravating it. It just sucks. Physical pain is so important to manage — having a perfect, pain-free body is one of the biggest blessings in the world, and we really take it for granted when we're younger.

I've been thinking a lot about how I can improve my posture and hip health. A lot of the issue comes from sitting too much. I don't move like I used to when I played baseball or other sports. The human body, like an orca in captivity, suffers when it isn't used. Orcas get "floppy fin syndrome" when their dorsal fin stops working because it isn't being exercised properly. Tendons, ligaments, and core muscles weaken if they're not used. If I just sit all day, my body loses its natural capabilities.

I need to actively focus on my whole body, not just the visible muscles. Most people focus on biceps, pecs, and glutes, the muscles you can see, but the real pain-causing areas are your pelvic floor, hips, posture, mobility, and flexibility. These are the things that truly matter. Pain is your brain requesting change — lower back pain, hip pain, shoulder pain — it's your body telling you something needs attention. Continuing to do isolated exercises like bicep curls or bench press won't fix these issues. Instead, I need to re-pattern my routines to respond to what my brain is signaling.

Going forward, my plan is:

- Work on aesthetic muscles two times per week.
- Focus on athleticism and compound full-body movements two times per week.
- Cardio two times per week.
- Daily focus on stretching, posture, mobility, and my weak areas.

For my hip specifically, ChatGPT suggested the issue is internal rotation. Drills like 90-90 internal rotation, glute ham raises, and re-pattern squats are key to staying pain-free and moving like a well-oiled machine.

This makes me think about what we could create to help others do the same. Maybe a tool or device — something fun and engaging that promotes full-body movement rather than static lifting. I imagine something like a full-body yo-yo, weighted at 10–20 pounds, or a tool that teaches tricks while training the whole body. Something that gets people moving, strengthening posture, mobility, and athleticism in a playful way.

For now, though, the priority is finding the cure for myself first.
