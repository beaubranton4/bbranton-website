I am beginning to realize that all I want is life is to wake up with a purpose. A distinct clarity on what I should be working towards every single moment. The one goal that should be prioritized over all other goals. 

At the moment, that is dugout edge for me, but I'm seriously questioning whether or not I should be working on something a lot more relevant with larger tailwinds. Obviously, I'm learning how to build with cloud code using AI agents and I'm way ahead on that front, but is building a little software tool for baseball coaches that will make 1K MRR max per month? Is that really the best use of my time? Focusing my time on the wrong thing is what I'm truly wondering.

I had this thought last night that I've been using cloud code, which is an AI agent, and it's been extremely powerful. I'm seeing how powerful it is to do a whole assortment of things on my computer. I feel like I'm doing things that are blowing my mind on a daily basis. I think that these are things just like with GenGPT that people just have to discover. It's not inherently known that a coding agent or an LLM is good for this specific use cases. I've discovered a lot of these separate things.

Maybe one example is programmatic SEO, building web pages of a certain sort, just like my drill's pages in my drill library in dugout edge. It took me like 10, 15 hours to get it perfect, but it built out the structure in one hour and allowed me to really see, okay, this is how the page needs to look like, this is how it's going to be structured. It generated 100 baseball drills for me with solid metadata and tags. Then it started ranking in a matter of days, which is incredible. There are also other sorts of things like updating my drills. There's just so much beyond even just like building out software for front end and back end, such as writing these journals. I think that all I'm doing to create so much like on the computer is all through a little chat box. How can I build a UI around that chat box and basically wrap cloud code? Cloud code wrappers is the goal for 2026. I think I literally wrote that in the last article and someone echoed that in an essay.


ChatGPT wrappers = single-turn generation. Claude Code wrappers = multi-file coordination, iteration, and structured outputs.

  Top 20 Non-Code Use Cases

  Document-Heavy Professional Work
  1. Legal document review - read contracts, flag issues, redline across multiple docs
  2. Grant/RFP writing - multi-section proposals with strict requirements
  3. Tax preparation - gather docs, fill forms, ensure consistency
  4. Immigration case management - forms, evidence, timelines
  5. Real estate transactions - document coordination, compliance checklists
  6. Insurance claims processing - read policies, gather evidence, draft responses

  Content & Publishing
  7. Book/manuscript editing - consistent edits across 50 chapters
  8. Translation projects - maintain voice/terminology across entire books
  9. Course creation - lessons, quizzes, materials, all interconnected
  10. Podcast production - transcript → show notes → clips → social posts → newsletter

  Research & Synthesis
  11. Academic paper writing - sections, citations, figures, bibliography
  12. Competitive research - analyze 20 companies, structured comparison output
  13. Due diligence - read data room, flag issues, create summary

  Personal/SMB Operations
  14. Job search management - tailored resumes, cover letters, application tracking
  15. Wedding/event planning - vendors, timelines, budgets, checklists
  16. Home renovation - quotes, permits, schedules, punch lists
  17. Personal finance - categorize a year of transactions, budget creation
  18. Genealogy - organize records, build trees, write family narratives

  Business Operations
  19. Meeting notes → action items → tasks → follow-up emails (the full loop)
  20. Content repurposing engine - one blog post → LinkedIn, Twitter threads, email, video script

  The Wrapper Pattern

  | ChatGPT Wrapper          | Claude Code Wrapper                                                                  |
  |--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | "Generate a recipe"      | "Organize my 200 recipes, standardize format, generate shopping lists, meal plans"   |
  | "Write a cover letter"   | "Manage my job search: track applications, tailor resumes per job, draft follow-ups" |
  | "Summarize this article" | "Read these 30 papers, create annotated bibliography, find contradictions"           |

  How to Bring to Masses

  1. Pick a painful niche - ideally where people currently use spreadsheets + Google Drive + manual coordination
  2. Build the UI layer - hide the file system, show domain-specific views (timeline, kanban, document list)
  3. Pre-configure context - the prompts, the expected file structures, domain knowledge
  4. Handle storage - users don't see "files," they see "contracts" or "chapters" or "vendors"
  5. Market the outcome - "AI paralegal" not "Claude Code for legal docs"

  The defensibility is the domain UX and accumulated context templates. Anyone can connect to Claude Code's API, but you've built the "immigration case IDE" that knows what forms exist, what evidence is needed, what the timeline looks like.

## 5 Ideas:

1. Building a personal to-do list/journal/productivity tracker in a customizable fashion
2. Reading data from different business sytems (i.e supabase, vercel, stripe) for analysis or for diagnosing what needs to be done. AI first analytics companies seem to be focused on simply querying data with natural language. But I think the next step in analytics is having more of a business partner, a thought partner, a second brain that will proactively bring up issues in the business, places for improvement, areas of opportunity, based on data. We all want data so that we can take actions and have data informed actions. People don't really care about the data itself per se. They want an insight. They want an actionable insight. They want questions answered that will help them improve the business at the end of the day. So, I think it is possible to build out a suite of tools based on the business. Give it complete context of businesses, hook it up to financial systems, hook it up to your marketing systems, your search console, your back end. If you are able to give an AI coding agent such as cloud code, access to all of this data and you create an agent that will work to analyze all of these different things. Maybe you build it out first where you build out the most important KPIs and then you have agents monitoring all of these at all times. You have these agents talk to each other. Then you can have a true data analyst who has a full comprehensive view of your business from a numerical standpoint, not a qualitative standpoint, can point out flaws, trends, patterns, areas of improvement.

3. Agents can create data for you. It can take raw text and classify and tag and create structured data from unstructured data.

4. A good claude code wrapper will be more about the UI and how it is marketed. As a general purpose agent it's really darn good at a lot of things. For me it's the IDE + claude code capabilities.

5. What sorts of ideas can i build an IDE for and plug claude code into. The main thing that comes to mind is a BI tool or a data tool. But what else?

6. In this new world of AI agents, the knowledge that you obtain, the things that you memorize aren't as valuable because knowledge is commonplace. But the things that you care about, the things that you think about, the questions you ask, the conversations that you have, that shed light into who you are and what you truly are passionate about. So what if there's some sort of social media that involves AI but it has more to do with what questions you ask, what you care about. Everybody wants to virtue signal their intelligence in some way. So how can we show that in the new age? I think that there could be a way to showcase how good people are at prompting, how good people are at managing AI agents, and we can show that in a verifiable way. I think that could be very helpful in businesses evaluating talent and evaluating people in this new world. Right? It's the same thing as when computers got invented. Businesses started to realize that people who could use computers, who could use software, those were the 10x multipliers. It's not the computers itself. It's the people who could use them. Same in this new world of AI. It's not the AI agents themselves. They can't do anything. They need someone to manage, coordinate, orchestrate them. So if we can create an objective, standardized way of testing how good people are at orchestrating, commanding, prompting these agents, that could be a really successful business, I think.

While all of Silicon Valley is so obsessed with automating away the work that humans are doing, what is it that can't be automated, that humans will start to care about once they realize that all of the work is being done by robots? What sorts of work will we care about then? What games will we play with ourselves to pass the time and keep ourselves busy before we hit the ground?
