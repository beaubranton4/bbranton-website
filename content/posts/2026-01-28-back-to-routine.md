The story of the day is "back to the routine." Work from home, run to Mountain Lake Park, got a jungle gym workout and walk back. Beautiful day, beautiful sunset. Then made some oyakodon for dinner.

A lot of progress made on Dugout Edge today: created a flyer for my favorite customer (Shawn) to post in his local training facility. Fixed some things with editing practice details, added league pricing page, added tool tracking analytics for the lesser used tools, pricing page updates.

Started a branch to work on some additional things like practice planner SEO, adding editing capabilities for custom drills (and custom video URL embed).

## The Xbox Controller Unlock

The biggest time unlock for me today was setting up controlling my Mac through an Xbox controller. Now that I use Super Whisper instinctively and most of the work that I'm doing on the computer can be done through an AI agent, I really don't need my keyboard and mouse all that much anymore. I only have a certain few commands that I'm actually using such as Option + Spacebar, left arrow, right arrow, scrolling, clicking around on my computer. I'm using Command + Shift for escape back. That's really it.

AI has allowed us to reduce the number of inputs needed or required in the user interface to communicate with computers. I think that this is a huge unlock, especially for me. I'm starting to get some back pains from sitting hunched over, tied to my keyboard and mouse all day. So I feel like this is one of the biggest things that I've done for my health and for productivity in a long time.

Theoretically, I can now work on my computer laying in bed with a projector if needed. The software that I used to set this all up is called Joy Mapper. I'm on the free trial right now, but I'm thinking about paying the $7.99 because I think it's that valuable. Setup took about 20 minutes, played around with it for another 20 minutes. I feel like I'm super capable. It's super intuitive and I'm able to do about 90% of the things that I want to do when vibe coding with Claude.

So, huge unlock.
