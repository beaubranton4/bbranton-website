It's incredible how fast time is flying. It's already October, and I swear it was just the new year. Last night I had trouble sleeping—my mind was racing with thoughts about everything I need to get done for Dugout Edge, plus small annoyances like the blinking fire alarm I just installed. Now that I know it's blinking, it's going to bug me until I replace it.

I've noticed something interesting about myself: whenever I abstain from smoking or taking edibles, I dream way more vividly. My thoughts at night become louder, almost relentless, sometimes even keeping me up. But I think the sleep I do get is deeper, better, more restorative—because I actually know I'm dreaming. It's ironic, because one of the reasons I lean on those habits is that they numb my mind and quiet down the constant chatter. My natural state is just thoughts, thoughts, thoughts. I'm continually lost in my own head, thinking about different things, solving problems, and running through scenarios.

But maybe that's also my superpower. That restless energy is what drives me. Even in the middle of the night, I'll wake up and jot down five things I need to do—not just little one-off tasks, but real direction-setting things. For example, last night I wrote about Dugout Edge: I need to build out a whole new mechanics section, add a section for facilities like batting cages, and even upload my picture to the MLB website for credibility down the road. Small ideas, maybe, but ones that add up.

I remind myself constantly that I need to do what makes a good story. I've been thinking a lot about the idea of showing your work. If you do great work but never put it out there, how can anyone find you? A squeaky wheel gets the oil. A broken one that stays silent never gets noticed at all. That's probably my biggest struggle—bragging. I'm confident inside, but I hate selling, marketing, or hyping myself.

Still, I think I'd be good at social media. I could probably build a big following, but I want to showcase something I'm genuinely proud of. Something physical feels more meaningful: like buying a batting cage, relaunching it in 90 days, and sharing that journey. That's a story. That's something people can latch onto.

Building a little micro SaaS app? Anyone can do that now, especially with AI tools. It's not impressive in itself. Maybe if I built a hundred of them and used that to quit my job, then sure—that's a story worth telling. But one small app pulling in $500 a month? Even if that's 5x where I'm at right now, it's not a story that excites me.

What I'm really searching for is that project. The big one. The one that feels viral, that has impact, that turns into a great story. Something people want to follow, share, and be inspired by. That's the energy I'm chasing.
