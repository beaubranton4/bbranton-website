excerpt: "Balancing the desire to focus deeply on Dugout Edge with the creative urge to explore multiple ideas and projects."

This morning I woke up really early, my brain already racing. I couldn't stop thinking about Dugout Edge—specifically, how I can implement the lineup system and the practice planner. The technical components are starting to make sense: how each part connects, how attributes interact, how the whole thing could flow together. I'm beginning to see a pretty clear vision of how to make a genuinely good practice planner. I haven't fully validated whether it's a great idea yet, but I've seen other apps that focus just on creating practice plans, so I think there's something there. It would complement the lineup generator really well.

I also found myself thinking about content—what I'd post if I actually started creating again. Would it be building in public content? Baseball content? My life? Funny videos? I feel this creative urge to put myself out there. I think I need that outlet. I actually think I'd be good at it, too, if I just worked on it. I just need to flex that muscle more. I'm not going to get good at baking the pie if I never bake pies.

These journals have been a good start. I'm learning how to self-reflect and articulate my thoughts, but I'm not sharing them—so I'm missing that feedback loop, that sense of whether anything resonates with people. Maybe that doesn't even matter right now.

One of the biggest thoughts I had this morning—the one that just wouldn't leave my head—is that I need to copy people. Copy what works and change one thing. That's what the founder of Method Soap said, and it's great advice. Steal like an artist. There's no need to reinvent the wheel every time.

Another thing I've been wrestling with is my constant urge to pursue many different things. I'm naturally a generalist, and in some ways that's great—it makes me adaptable and creative. But deep focus is equally important, especially when building a business. Being well-rounded is awesome, but a lack of focus can keep you from actually reaching your goals.

Still, my brain runs wild with ideas: I want to start a hat company. I want to build landing pages that drive traffic for in-person businesses in Pacific Heights or Honolulu—things like med spa or tree trimming referrals. I want to experiment with lead generation for real-world businesses using what I know about online growth. And then there's this idea of an automated content system—something that just constantly creates and posts. I actually think that's possible.

And maybe that's okay. Maybe there's nothing wrong with having all these desires. People like Mark Liu and other indie hackers run multiple projects. Once one starts to take off, they move to the next one. There's nothing wrong with that. But I don't want to be the guy who gives up when he's 90% there. It's so much easier to keep a fire going than to start a brand-new one.
