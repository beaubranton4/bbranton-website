It was a really nice weekend spending time with my parents. I forgot to journal last night. Got a little bit too carried away on my computer.

Quick recap Saturday morning, golf at Alouai with my dad and his golf buddies. Always a good time, still shaking off the rust of not having played for a couple of months, but always a good time. I think I figured out something with the golf grip that will really make my swing a lot more consistent. Looking forward to trying it out tomorrow with some of my buds at West Lock, which we'll be playing around at four tomorrow.

After golf, I got to catch up with my parents' friends. At Uselo, the Nordstrom restaurant. Had a nice nap. Had a watch "Martin's Supreme". What a crazy movie. Barely about ping pong at all. Which is, you know, to be expected for an A24 movie. But I really liked how many twists and turns and how chaotic of a story it was. I kept thinking about the story worthy framework of how to tell a good story and what makes a good story. "Martin's Supreme" definitely had all of those elements.

This morning got a good workout in, hiked the Makapu Lighthouse trail with my parents, had a nice lunch at Koko Marina, then relaxed at home with some J. Dolan's pizza and watched Roof Man.

The story of today can be told by these images. Mom and I taking selfies up on the pillboxes while dad surfs his phone waiting for us at the bottom.
